Its relatively low ride height eases access, and the cabin stays amazingly quiet inside, a quality shared with the Ram. The spacious interior is nicely finished overall. A coil-spring rear suspension\u2014unique for full-sized pickups\u2014 gives it a smooth ride, the powertrain is a gem, and the whisper-quiet cabin makes the truck feel like a luxury vehicle. We tested a four-wheel-drive Big Horn version with Chrysler's 5.7-liter Hemi V8 and a new eight-speed automatic transmission that's smooth and efficient. When pushed to its limits, the Ram proved clumsy, typical of a big truck, but ultimately secure and predictable. Pickup trucks Ratings ",

Right now, homes are valued 4~5 times the rate of inflation, the peak was hit a couple months ago, and we are seeing the defaults. While I'm not sure where you're pulling the $60k figure for a Big Horn, unless you're comparing a base 2020 Big Horn vs a pretty loaded 2023 Big Horn (MSRP starts at $47k for a crew cab Big Horn per the Ram website), I agree in principle that Ram prices have shot up over the past few years and are unattainable for many.
