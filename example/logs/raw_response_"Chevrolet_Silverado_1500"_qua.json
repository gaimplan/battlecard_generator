    "answer": "The Chevrolet Silverado 1500 generally demonstrates above-average quality and durability. According to RepairPal, it has a reliability rating of 3.5 out of 5, which is considered above average. The average annual repair and maintenance cost for a Silverado 1500 is $714, which is lower than the average for full-size trucks. Owners typically need to bring their vehicles in for unscheduled repairs 0.2 times per year, less frequently than the average for full-size trucks and all vehicle models. The probability of a repair being severe or major is 16%, slightly lower than the average for full-size trucks. However, some owners have reported mixed experiences with reliability, particularly for certain model years. Issues such as problems with the AFM system, transmission, and excessive oil consumption have been noted in some older models. When considering a used Silverado, it's advisable to research specific model years to avoid potential problem areas. Overall, while the Silverado 1500 demonstrates good durability, individual experiences may vary depending on the specific model year and maintenance history.",

It was traded in a the Toyota dealership with only 4000 miles on it (concern #1).  \nI have seen a number of mixed reviews in 2020 and 2021 Silverados with some saying that they are some of the least reliable vehicles made which I find pretty stunning for trucks like this.  \nI purchased my 2011 Silverado with 35,000 miles on it and sold it at 102,000 miles. That being said I was willing to put up with all the small stuff that continually breaks these vehicles. Window switches, latch handles, bed liner screws that fall out and even the door handle coming off in my hand. After all these were all pretty cheap fixes but one would figure these issues might have been rectified since the 1970's but that's a different topic for another day.  \nWhen the 2011 hit 80,000 miles the issues really started to pop up......and the car virtually starting falling apart at 90K with the final year of ownership costing me about $2200 in repairs.

The rest of the truck is similar enough electronics wise to previous GM trucks so that will be fairly solid, same with the chassis.  \nSo it boils down to the powertrain. The 5.3 and 6.2 are similar to the older motors found in the k2xx trucks, with the exception of the new DFM system. Which is essentially the AFM system but on all 8 cylinders now instead of just 4. In my opinion that just double the chances of a failure.  \nThe new 3.0 diesel and the 2.7 are still up for grabs as far as reliability goes. I have my doubts about the 2.7. It may be a decent motor but I don't see it holding up long term, and see it having the same issues as the Ford ecoturd motors have. The problem is you can expect so much out of a small engine and still expect it to last as long as a larger engine that doesn't need to work nearly as hard to make its power.  \nThe 3.0 is the engine that most interests me at this point. It has potential to be a winner if it holds up.\n2015 Duramax, 1986 M1031, 2006 1500HD\nSave Share\nReply Quote  Like\n\nZ15\n5772 posts \u00b7 Joined 2010\n\nAdd to quote\nOnly show this user\n\n#7 \u00b7 Mar 6, 2021\nOne of my local customer drives a company owned 2020 Silverado 4wd Custom Crew with the 2.7L turbo 4.

Pretty sure I've seen car magazines testing it and there's hardly any difference in fuel mileage. And if there isn't any, then why go with a four banger? And if mpg is a concern for somebody, then they shouldn't be looking at half ton trucks.  \nJust my 2 cents.

Here's mine:  \nMy 2010 with the 5.3l was an amazing truck. I drove it pretty hard, but also took very good care of it mechanically. I had it for 130k miles, and it never left me stranded. Just a few minor things from time to time. Amazing truck, and I actually miss it. Ran as good at 130k as the day I got it.  \nWhen I bought the 2021, I went right back to the 5.3l, after briefly considering the 3.0 Diesel. The current 5.3l feels more powerful that the old one. The body on my 2021 feels like it is carved out of one piece of metal. Just this morning I crossed a railroad track and even with a big bump, there was not one single squeak, shudder...nothing. Since I only have 1200 miles on it, I cannot speak to reliability. I think with the right care, I have no reason to believe this is not a long term truck. I would not be as comfortable with the 2.7 long term, just because of how hard it's going to work to achieve the same result. But overall, I am and will be a GM fan for years to come.\n\nNEW: 2021 Silverado LT Z71, 5.3L, Katzkin leather, soft tonneau, bedliner\nOLD: 2010 Sierra All Terrain, 5.3L, Range AFM delete, 2.5\" level lift, Grenade XD wheels, 305/55/20 Nitto Terra Grapplers\nSave Share\nReply Quote  Like\nT\nTatsngats\n1637 posts \u00b7 Joined 2015\n\nAdd to quote\nOnly show this user\n\n#12 \u00b7 Mar 6, 2021\nSo, out of curiosity, what current brand/model truck does everyone think is probably most reliable? I would say Tundra's track record speaks for itself but every other brand seems hit or miss. The new 2021 F-150's with the 5.0 have cylinder shutdown now as well, so that could be a reliability issue in an engine that otherwise has a great track record. The Hemi is a great engine but those trucks have several other known issues. So what do we do???  \nBTW, my 2011 5.3 with 125k on it has been great.

I also prefer the interior of the current lineup. I never cared for the little bubble like buttons on the steering wheel of the K2XX.

As someone who spent about 4 months looking for a late model (or brand new) GMC or Chevy, I can attest to the complaints about fit/finish, as well as reliability.  \nVirtually every used truck I drove had some relatively serious issue... noises, shakes, clunks. Some of the dealers were in complete denial. One guy told me he had been personally driving a 3-year old Denali, and it was so smooth. I took it for a test drive and it shook my teeth loose at highway speeds, LOL. Also made very strange noises while shifting, ugh. PLUS it had cigar smell, the whole experience was hilarious.  \nAnd the brand new trucks (for BIG $$$$$$$) felt like the interiors were cheapified as much as absolutely possible. Just a shame.

These Chevy trucks are renowned for their exceptional towing capabilities, powerful engine options, and rugged durability. However, like all vehicles, certain model years stand out for their reliability. Others have garnered notoriety for having persistent issues.\nWhether you\u2019re in the market for a new or used Silverado, or simply curious about the truck\u2019s evolution, understanding which generations are better and which are worse can help you make informed decisions. Let\u2019s explore the best Chevy Silverados\u2026 and some of the worst.\nBest Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Model Years\nMany of the Silverado 1500 model years are fantastic choices for those seeking a dependable and capable full-size pickup truck.\n2005 and 2006 Silverado\nThese model years from the first generation are some of the most reliable and trouble-free Silverado models to date. With fewer reported issues compared to their contemporaries, the 2005 and 2006 models offer a solid combination of power, capability, and dependability.\n2007 Silverado\nIf you purchase a used 2007 Chevy Silverado, you can expect great things. This award-winning pickup truck offers improved powertrain options, a comfortable interior, and fewer reported issues than many other Silverado models.\n2019 \u2013 Present Silverado Models\nThe latest variations of the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 are currently being praised for their overall quality, advanced features, and reliable performance. Their strong engines offer decent gas mileage and have received few complaints. Thus far, any current-generation Silverado model would make an excellent choice for work or for leisure.\n\nOne of the worst model years for the Chevy Silverado 1500 was 2014.\nWorst Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Model Years\nWhile the Silverado 1500 has enjoyed a reputation for durability and reliability, certain model years have become infamous among buyers.\nLooking for vehicles near you?\nWe'll email you with vehicles up for auction near you and featured auctions.\n2002 Silverado\nThis model year from the first generation is notorious for engine and brake malfunctions. Specific complaints cited excessive oil consumption, faulty engine cooling, and other dangerous malfunctions.\n2012 and 2013 Silverado\nThese models are among the worst years in the Silverado 1500\u2019s second generation. Consumers complained about transmission, engine, and interior accessory problems. If you\u2019re considering buying a used truck, count these models as some of the Chevy Silverado 1500 years to avoid.\n2014, 2015, 2017 Silverado\nAll three of these year models come from the third generation; they\u2019re the three most complained about Chevrolet Silverado models to date. These are the Chevy Silverado 1500 years to avoid, without question. Think twice about buying a used truck from any of these iterations. You\u2019re likely to find electrical issues, rusted brake lines, problems with the intake manifold, and so many more issues it\u2019s difficult to name them all.\n\nThis Chevy Silverado 1500 comes from the very first generation.\nFirst Generation: The Groundwork (1999-2006)\nThe first generation Silverado in 1999 marked a transition from the long-running\u00a0\u201cC/K\u201d series pickups, popular in the 1960s. This new generation offered a modern, refined, and more comfortable interior, yet still retained the ruggedness and capability expected from full-size trucks. Also included were\u00a0driver message centers and Vortec V8 engines.\nWhile the early years of this generation (1999-2003) were generally well-received, some owners reported issues with the automatic transmission and excessive oil consumption. The\u00a02002 model year\u00a0stands out as particularly problematic, with numerous complaints related to the brakes, engine, and fuel system. The latter part of this generation (2004-2006) saw improvements in overall reliability with no major problems. The 2006 model, in fact, is cited by some as one of the best years for the first generation Silverado, evidenced by a decrease in consumer complaints.\n\nThis model comes from the second generation of the Chevy Silverado 1500.\nSecond Generation: Refinement and Power (2007-2013)\nThe second generation of the Silverado 1500, introduced in 2007, brought significant enhancements to interior quality, safety features, and powertrain options. This generation saw powerful engine choices, including the capable 6.2-liter V8. And unlike the previous generation, this one made use of\u00a0two and four-wheel drivetrains. Buyers were so pleased with this next Chevy Silverado that the 2007 model year won\u00a0North American Truck of the Year.\nHowever, the later years of this generation (2012-2013) were plagued by various issues. The\u00a02012 model year\u00a0encountered plenty of transmission, engine, and interior accessory problems. The\u00a0following model year had more of the same problems, and if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, it received a higher number of complaints surrounding the vehicle body and paint.\n\nThe third generation of the Chevy Silverado 1500 came with a fresh design and new features.\nThird Generation: Modern Refinement, Modern Problems (2014-2018)\nThe third generation Silverado 1500 came in 2014. It brought a fresh design, improved fuel efficiency, and a host of advanced technology features to the market. General Motors introduced a new EcoTec3 engine, which resulted in stronger performance and fuel economy.\nHowever, these four years did not produce the most reliable Chevy Silverado models. The earliest years (2014-2015) were an unmitigated disaster for the Silverado. The\u00a02014 version\u00a0has some of the highest number of complaints in Chevy history. The Silverado released the following year had fewer complaints, but is still the second highest complained-about model in the vehicle\u2019s history. There were air conditioning problems, engine problems, transmission complaints, and many more complaints. The list goes on.\nResults did improve somewhat for the Silverado model years that followed. The 2016 model experienced less complaints, and the 2018 model experienced the least within this generation. But both still reported the same problems, as well as certain electrical problems, steering wheel concerns, and brake failure.\nIn comparison to other trucks, this generation of Chevrolet Silverados 1500 were neither ideal family vehicles nor work trucks. These were the Chevy Silverado 1500 years to avoid. However, change was on the horizon.\nFourth Generation: The Current Era (2019-Present)\nThe pickup trucks of the fourth generation were brought to consumers in 2019. Unlike older models, these Silverado models boast a more aggressive exterior, a more spacious and technologically advanced interior, and a range of powertrain options. Examples would be the powerful 6.2-liter V8 and a fuel-efficient turbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine.\nWhile the reliability of this latest generation is still too new to definitively assess, none of them have a poor rating, which means the best years for the Chevy Silverado could be soon to come. The pickup truck with the worst rating this generation is the\u00a02019 model, and the complaints somewhat surpass the 2018 model. After that, the numbers drop.\nThe latest Chevrolet Silverado lineup has been generally well-received, with owners praising the truck\u2019s performance and overall quality.\n\nOne of the best model years for the Chevy Silverado 1500 was 2007.\nCommon Issues and Potential Problems\nChevrolet Silverado models all come with their fair share of pros and cons, some of which have repeated throughout the generations. If you\u2019re looking to buy one, car dealerships should supply you with all the relevant information for your desired vehicle. However, aside from making sure you take the truck for a test drive, also be on the lookout for these common problems:\nTransmission Problems\nThe Silverado\u2019s most notorious for transmission problems\u2013 they\u2019re the most common issues with the brand, and they can have several causes. The most common issues include the car bucking or jerking, the car shuddering, hard shifts between gears, or general \u2018jerkiness\u2019. Some of the more severe transmission problems include losing the ability to go into first or fourth gear, the transmission entering \u201climp home\u201d mode (which restricts the car to second and third gear or reverse gear), and the car suddenly downshifting into first gear.\nThese transmission issues can be caused by failed shift solenoids or by issues with the software in the car\u2019s PCM. Model years particularly affected include 2002, 2012, and 2017. Chevrolet\u2019s even faced several recalls thanks to these problems.\nExcessive Oil Consumption\nMany owners have reported excessive oil consumption, particularly in the early model years of each generation. This issue can be caused by various factors, including faulty piston rings, valve guides, or other engine components.\nOne of the most common causes, however, is faults with the Generation 4 Vortec engine and its Active Fuel Management system. The AFM system is supposed to disable engine cylinders when you\u2019re not using them to help you save gas. Unfortunately, it was faulty, especially in the years between 2010 and 2014, which are definitely some of the Chevy Silverado model years to avoid. The flaws in the system meant that oil would frequently end up in the combustion chamber. It would get burned up, and your Silverado would chug oil like a Captain Planet villain.\nIt\u2019s normal for a high mileage engine to go through fuel quickly and inefficiently. But the Generation 4 Vortec engine is bad enough, even when it\u2019s relatively new, that you want to take precautions to avoid these oil issues. You can get an aftermarket device that plugs into your engine and disables the AFM system. If the AFM hasn\u2019t already damaged your engine, this device can keep it from doing so. General Motors also recommends changing your valve cover with an updated design to help with the oil problems.\nFuel System Issues\nAll trucks can have fuel issues; it\u2019s the nature of the internal combustion engine. But the Chevy Silverado 1500 has some special fuel system issues, thanks, once again, to the AFM system.\nThe oil problems are the first horseman of the Silverado apocalypse. They lead to much, much worse problems later on. Leaking oil passes through the pistons and accumulates on the engine\u2019s cylinders, reducing the engine\u2019s horsepower and damaging the engine. If you\u2019re particularly unlikely, it can even lead to a misfire.\nThe AFM system is really only a problem in second and third generation Silverados, and it\u2019s worth pointing out that most Silverados that featured the AFM don\u2019t have serious problems. The AFM\u2019s failures are a pretty serious flaw with the truck model, but most Chevy Silverados won\u2019t experience problems with it. This isn\u2019t the Ford Pinto.\nHydraulic Valve Lifter Issues\nA hydraulic valve lifter controls a car engine\u2019s valves, regulating how much gas is going into the engine. If it fails, the valve will get stuck and stay closed, and then your car won\u2019t start. It\u2019s the automotive equivalent of a heart attack. Worse, a collapsed lifter can hit the camshaft, tearing off tiny metal shavings that can cause some real damage to your engine. And the AFM system makes Chevy Silverados more prone to hydraulic valve lifter issues.\nIf you\u2019re having hydraulic valve lifter issues, you might hear a \u2018tick\u2019 or \u2018chirp\u2019 sound from your engine. Your car might not start easily; it might misfire or stall. You might see a \u201ccheck engine\u201d prompt on your dashboard. If you\u2019re really unlucky, your car might give out in the middle of an intersection. So, if your Chevy Silverado starts \u2018ticking\u2019, that\u2019s a ticking time bomb; get it to the mechanic immediately.\nElectrical System Issues\nElectrical system problems, such as faulty sensors, wiring issues, and malfunctioning electronics, have been reported across various model years. The most common sensor issues are in the oil pressure gauge. When damaged, it might display an oil pressure of zero, or flash the \u201ccheck oil\u201d light repeatedly.\nBut all the other dashboard gauges (including, worryingly, the speedometer) are prone to issues. You might hit a bump and have your entire dash turn off, or have the battery light turn on even when your car is fully charged. These issues are generally caused by faulty motors in the sensors or by bad solder connections. Thankfully, it\u2019s an easy fix for a mechanic.\nThe 2012, 2014, and 2016 models are most prone to these issues. Since they\u2019ve already got the Generation 4 Vortec engine, these are definitely some of the Chevy Silverado 1500 years to avoid.\nWindow Issues\nThe Chevy Silverado has some commonly reported issues with windows. One common issue is that the power windows will stop working. This can be caused by some of the electrical issues we mentioned earlier- bad solder connections, faulty motors, or damaged switches. It can also be caused by a broken window regulator (the part of the vehicle that actually moves the windows up and down), but this is less common. This isn\u2019t a serious issue, but it\u2019s one you need to address in case your vehicle\u2019s electrical system has more serious issues.\nAnother common window issue is that the rear windows may start to leak. This is commonly caused by faulty window seals or a bad gasket around the brake light. If you find water on the back seat of your car, or are seeing wet carpets and water staining, you should take your car to the mechanic. Compared to some of the issues on this list, it\u2019s a minor problem, but again, it can show more serious problems in the car\u2019s electrical system.\nAll in all, being aware of these potential problems can help you, as the prospective buyer, make informed decisions and budget wisely.\n\nDespite having various repeat issues, the Chevy Silverado 1500 has been a mainstay in the automotive industry.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhen considering the purchase of a used Chevrolet truck, potential buyers often have questions regarding reliability, common issues, and which Chevy Silverado 1500 years to avoid. Here are some frequently asked questions and their answers:\nWhich Silverado models have transmission problems?\n2002 Silverados and Silverados from the 2012-2017 model years had the most transmission-related complaints. Vehicles from the fourth generation have mostly avoided this issue.\nWhich Silverado engine is most reliable?\nWhile engine reliability can vary based on maintenance and driving conditions, the 5.3-liter V8 and the 6.2-liter V8 engines are generally regarded as some of the most reliable and durable options in the Silverado lineup.\nWhich Silverado engine is least reliable?\nIf you\u2019re looking to buy a Chevy Silverado, you want to avoid the Generation 4 Vortec engine. The Gen 4 Vortec is a 5.3-liter V8, and those are normally quite reliable\u2013 but its Active Fuel Management system causes many, many problems. The AFM system is a major factor in why the 2012 and 2014 Silverado model years are notorious for engine problems. You want to avoid a Gen 4 Vortec engine at all costs\u2013 any Chevy Silverado 1500 year model with a Gen 4 Vortec engine is one of the Chevy Silverado 1500 model years to avoid.\nWhich year 5.3 engine should I stay away from?\nThe Generation 4 Vortec engine is the least reliable V8 engine used in Chevy Silverados. Its AFM system causes problems with the engine, the fuel system, and sometimes even the e makes the third generation Silverados some of the Chevy Silverado 1500 model years to avoid.\nIs it better to buy a used or new Silverado?\nWhile a new Silverado offers the latest features and a full warranty, a well-maintained used model can still provide excellent value and reliability, but at a lower cost.\nThe oldest models of Silverado are extremely reliable and have already lasted for two full car generations. The models made between 2010 and 2020, however, have design flaws that make them less reliable\u2013 the AFM system, in particular, might give you problems if you\u2019re planning to use your Silverado as a family vehicle.\nBut either a used or new Silverado can be a great purchase, if you\u2019re careful and do your research. What you ultimately decide should depend on your budget and intended use.\nHow many miles can a Silverado 1500 typically last?\nA Silverado 1500 can easily\u00a0last 200,000 miles. However, the longevity of the truck depends on various factors, including driving conditions, load hauling, and maintenance history.\nWhat is the most common problem with Chevy Silverado trucks?\nTransmission issues and excessive oil consumption are among the most commonly reported problems with Chevy Silverado trucks. These issues are often caused by the Gen 4 Vortec engine\u2019s Active Fuel Management system, and if you can pick up a Silverado that doesn\u2019t use it, you\u2019ll be happier in the long run.\nSilverados are also prone to engine problems and various concerns with the electrical system.\nWhich is better, a Silverado 1500 or Ram 1500?\nThe choice between a Silverado and a Ram 1500 often comes down to intended use and specific features desired. Both trucks offer capable performance, a range of powertrain options, and various trim levels to suit different needs and budgets. It\u2019s worth noting that some of the Chevy Silverado\u2019s worst years were some of the Ram 1500\u2019s best. But the Silverado and the Ram are equally reliable, and when they do break down, they can both suffer from transmission and engine issues. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preferences.\nWhich is better, a Silverado 1500 or a Ford F-150?\nAgain, the choice between a Silverado 1500 and a Ford F-150 often comes down to personal preferences. They\u2019re approximately equal in terms of performance, features, and reliability. One factor you may want to take into account is that some of the Chevy Silverado\u2019s worst years were some of the Ford F-150\u2019s best. If you\u2019re interested in a used car from 2014, the Ford F-150 is the way to go; conversely, if you\u2019re interested in a used car from 2006, you want the Chevy Silverado.\nConclusion\nThe Chevrolet Silverado 1500 has a rich history and a loyal following among truck enthusiasts and professionals alike. While certain model years have garnered praise for their reliability and overall quality, others have been marred by persistent complaints that make them the Chevy Silverado 1500 years to avoid.\nIf you\u2019re considering a used Silverado 1500, do your research. Look into the specific model year, know its issues, and figure out vehicle\u2019s maintenance history. Consulting reliable sources, such as owner forums, expert reviews, and reliability ratings, can provide valuable insights and help you make an informed decision.\nBy understanding the best and worst years for the Silverado 1500, as well as the most common issues to watch out for, you can increase your chances of finding a reliable and capable truck that meets your needs and expectations.\nIf you\u2019re looking to find a\u00a0pickup truck\u00a0that is used and well-maintained, one great place to start looking is with Municibid!

The Silverado 1500 comes close with its tow rating of up to 13,300 pounds, and they both beat the 2025 Ram 1500, with its max of 11,550 pounds. Even so, we rate the Ram higher for its smoother ride quality and refined interior. The Toyota Tundra has a similar suspension design with corresponding ride-quality advantages, and it's also available with a hybrid powertrain.\nEdmunds Expert Rating\nOur VerdictThe Edmunds Vehicle Testing Team evaluates a fresh batch of vehicles every week, pairing objective assessments at our test track with real-world driving on city streets, freeways and winding roads. The data we gather results in our Expert Ratings. They\u2019re based on 30-plus scores that cover every aspect of the automotive experience.\nAverage\n7.5\nout of 10\nedmunds TESTED\nThe 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 stays true to its old-school roots, and the latest updates to the interior and technology do a lot to help this truck be more competitive against its full-size rivals. But lackluster comfort and value keep it from being a top pick.\nRated for you by America's best test team.\nPerformance\n7.5/10\nHow does the Silverado 1500 drive? We tested a Silverado crew cab in the High Country trim with the 5.3-liter V8 and four-wheel drive. Acceleration and braking are sufficient for daily driving or towing. Our test truck covered 60 mph in about 7 seconds from a standstill at our test track. An equivalent F-150 is a little quicker, but there's nothing wrong with the Silverado's power. Around town, the transmission shifts smoothly and makes the most of the engine's low-end torque.  \nThe truck tracks straight on the highway, but the steering effort is a bit too light. Handling is secure, and body roll is effectively held in check as you navigate turns. But midcorner bumps can upset the Silverado pretty easily. Going off-road? A regular 4WD Silverado will suffice, but consider getting the Z71 off-road option package or the Trail Boss trim level to enhance its potential.\nRead more\nComfort\n7/10\nHow comfortable is the Silverado 1500? The Silverado's seating isn't quite as plush as the seats in the F-150 or Ram 1500, yet there's enough padding and support to keep you comfortable on long drives. The ride is relatively smooth on the highway, and the truck ably absorbs most small impacts. But it can get bouncy when you drive on roads that have a high frequency of bumps and dips.  \nThe climate system easily heats and cools the cabin, though operating it can be a little tricky because a lot of the control buttons are small. We really like the optional ventilated and split-heated front seats (separate settings for the seatback and seat cushion), a GM-exclusive feature. Engine noise is effectively muted until you get aggressive with the throttle, at which point it gets a bit unpleasant.\nRead more\nInterior\n7.5/10\nHow\u2019s the interior? Chevrolet finally provided the sorely needed interior upgrade Silverado owners have wanted for years. The latest cabin design looks and feels far more modern than the one used for the 2019-2021 trucks, with sporty elements on the ZR2 trim and upscale materials on top-tier trims like the High Country. Importantly, most of the controls are easy to use, a staple of the previous model, with large clear buttons and a swift touchscreen.  \nInside, the Silverado has plenty of space for adults in its crew-cab configuration. This is particularly evident in the back seat, which has massive legroom to offer. Some models sit high off the ground, but large door openings and proper seat positioning make overall accessibility a positive experience.\nRead more\nContinue reading Edmunds Expert Rating below\nSave as much as $7,059\u00a0with Edmunds Click on the trim you\u2019re interested in to see what Edmunds suggests you should pay to get a good deal.

Technology is a strong point in the Silverado. An available 13.4-inch touchscreen offers a wide range of capability without confusing the user, and the hi-res screen responds quickly to clicks and swipes. There are also clear maps, and navigation finds addresses and points of interest quickly. Plus, the Google-powered voice recognition system understands natural language and reads your command back to you on the screen. With your voice, you can change the station, adjust the climate control and more.  \nOur test truck came with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, both with wireless connectivity. CarPlay looked great on the massive screen. There's a dedicated storage space for your smartphone, and some models include a wireless charger. Driver aids are abundant, with several available exterior cameras that help when parking this behemoth of a truck. The rear cross-traffic warning system and its helpful buzzes in the seat bottom are effective too.  \nAdaptive cruise control generally works well, particularly for such a large vehicle. However, we did experience one instance with our test truck where it unexpectedly lurched forward with the system on in stop-and-go traffic; our driver had to quickly apply the brakes to override it. This put a stain on an otherwise positive experience. GM's hands-free driver assist technology, Super Cruise, is available but only on the top-trim High Country \u2014 Ford offers its similar BlueCruise system on several F-150 trims.\nRead more\nTowing and Storage\n8/10\nHow are the towing and storage? We tested a 5.3-liter V8-powered, short-bed 4WD crew-cab truck that had the standard 3.23 axle gearing. This configuration provided plenty of towing and hauling capability for our needs. As for the bed itself, it's a bit longer, deeper and wider than its rivals, and it has more tie-downs.  \nThe Silverado's boxy center console contains multiple pockets, but we've found the F-150's and Ram 1500's center consoles to be a little more versatile for storing items. For family duty, the crew cab's back seat has two sets of lower car seat anchors and three top tethers, so child safety seats will fit in any of the three positions. But loading the seats, not to mention the kiddos, might be difficult due to the truck's ride height.\nRead more\nContinue reading Edmunds Expert Rating below\nFuel Economy\n7.5/10\nHow\u2019s the fuel economy? The Silverado High Country we tested had the 5.3-liter V8 and 4WD, which earns an EPA-estimated 17 mpg in combined city/highway driving. We found that number to be reasonably achievable in the real world. The best fuel economy for the Silverado comes from the available diesel-fueled six-cylinder.\nValue\n6.5/10\nIs the Silverado 1500 a good value? The Silverado isn't outrageously expensive, but it is priced higher than its key rivals without offering any advantages in features, style or interior quality. The buttons and dashboard plastics are similar to those in the previous-gen truck: sturdy but somewhat cheap-looking. Chevy's warranty coverage is average, though you do get the first scheduled maintenance for free.\nRead more\nWildcard\n7/10\nFull-size trucks such as the Silverado aren't necessarily fun to drive. But with its commanding view of the road, lots of towing power, and brutish front-end styling, the Silverado can put a smile on your face. However, the interior looks dated and borrows many pieces and design cues from the previous generation. It may or may not be the full-size truck personality you want.\nRead more\nWhich Silverado 1500 does Edmunds recommend?\nWith nine distinct models and four engines to choose from, the Silverado 1500 gives shoppers plenty of options to suit their particular needs. For many, the midrange LT will be a good fit, offering a much nicer interior than the basic Work Truck while forgoing all-terrain features and luxury items that may not be needed.\nCompare 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 trim levels\nHelpful trims summary and side-by-side comparison chart\nChevrolet Silverado 1500 models\nThe 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is a full-size pickup available in nine trim levels: Work Truck (WT), Custom, Custom Trail Boss, LT, RST, LT Trail Boss, ZR2, LTZ and High Country. Like most full-size trucks, the Silverado is offered in varying cab and bed configurations, including a two-door regular cab, a four-door extended cab (Double Cab), and a four-door crew cab with full-size rear doors and generous rear seat room. Depending on cab selection, the three available bed sizes are an 8-foot-long bed, a 6.5-foot bed and a shorter 5-foot-8-inch bed.

No way to override it.\nTruck for work or pleasure\n5 out of 5 stars\nValor Trooper , 09/24/2024\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LTZ 4dr Crew Cab 5.8 ft. SB (5.3L 8cyl 10A)\nI traded a 2020 Chevy Silverado LTZ crew cab, leather seats, black exterior color, short bed, 4x4 with Z71 options, 8 speed transmission, and 5.3 v8 for a 2024 Chevy Silverado LTZ crew cab, leather seats, metallic silver color, short bed, 4x4 minus the Z71 options, 10 speed transmission, and 5.3 v8. The 2024 Chevy Silverado has options( automatic steps, multi purpose tailgate, heads up\u00a0\u2026 display, 22 inch tires w/chrome wheels, power sun roof, power rear center window, and sprayed bed liner) some of which were not part of the 2020 Chevy Silverado. The 2024 Chevy minus the Z71 option with 22 inch wheels and road style tires rides a bit smoother than my 2020 Chevy. I still maintain the 4x4 capability when needed especially with the Illinois winters and some mild off road traveling. The shift/gear selector is now located on the center console rather than the steering column which provides no inconvenience for either use or position placement. At my senior age of 81 and before I have always enjoyed my trucks and have had quite a few including Chevy, GMC, Ford, & Toyota trucks. The 2024 Silverado LTZ continues to be a pricey purchase as truck prices across the brand spectrum are all pricey purchases. I am pleased with my 2024 Silverado with regard to performance and design. This is my first metallic silver exterior color which looks great and reflects the sun heat better than my previous black exterior colored trucks. If price is not a limiting factor, I believe you would enjoy owning and driving a full size 1500, Silverado LTZ.\nRead more\nRead less\nWe have a limited number of reviews for the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500, so we've included reviews for other years of the Silverado 1500 since its last redesign.\nSee all 38 reviews of the Chevrolet Silverado 1500\nWrite a vehicle review\nHelpful shopping links\n\n\nSee All for Sale\n\n\nBuild & Price\n\n\nDeals & Incentives\n\n\nLease Offers\n\n\nPrice Checker\u2122\n\n\nShop Used\n\n\n2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 video\nFord F-150 Tremor vs. Ram 1500 Rebel vs. Chevy Silverado Trail Boss | Off-Road Comparison Test\nFord F-150 Tremor vs. Ram 1500 Rebel vs. Chevy Silverado Trail Boss | Off-Road Comparison Test\nWe\u2019re putting America\u2019s best-selling trucks \u2014 the Ford F-150, Chevy Silverado and Ram 1500 \u2013 up against one another on the trails.

It's one of the most successful vehicles on sale in terms of sheer units moved, and it's always given the Ford F-150 a run for its money. The Silverado received a major face-lift for 2022 that brought its interior right up to date with rivals from Ford and Ram. There's plenty to pick from in the powertrain department too. Its standard turbocharged four-cylinder engine is no slouch \u2014 it produces more torque than the 5.3-liter V8 and almost as much as the 6.2-liter V8. Chevy also offers a turbodiesel engine for the Silverado, which is significant because both the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500 no longer do. Because of those recent updates, we doubt we'll see any significant changes for 2025.\nEdmunds spotlight: Class-leading interior tech\nWith its 2022 face-lift, Chevy brought the Silverado's interior tech bang up to date. It did better than that \u2014 it built a class leader. Chevy based its new infotainment on Google's software, and the results are a more responsive system, the best voice recognition in the business, and features like Alexa and the Google Play Store to help you control your home from your car and tailor the infotainment experience to exactly what your needs are with Google apps. But don't worry \u2014 it still has Apple CarPlay and Android Auto despite GM's move away from the phone mirroring software in its newer models.\nCompetitors to consider\nThe Silverado's archrival, the Ford F-150, is always an option when you're looking at a Silverado. The Ford offers more tech and a hybrid model that can power off-board accessories and work tools. The Ford also recently got a big face-lift that brings with it more power for base models and updated Raptor models. If you want something that can go off-road fast, the Raptor is the way to go (and a car Chevy has no answer for).\nEdmunds says\nThe Silverado is a solid buy even if the F-150 lineup is more well rounded.\n\nFAQ\nIs the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 a good car?\nThe Edmunds experts tested the 2025 Silverado 1500 both on the road and at the track, giving it a 7.5 out of 10.
