Taking its name from the top trim level from the Chevrolet C/K series, the Silverado is offered as a series of full-size pickup trucks, chassis cab trucks, and medium-duty trucks. The fourth generation of the model line was introduced for the 2019 model year.\nThe Chevrolet Silverado shares mechanical commonality with the identically related GMC Sierra; GMC ended the use of the C/K nomenclature a model generation prior to Chevrolet. In Mexico, high-trim level versions of the Silverado use the Chevrolet Cheyenne name (not to be confused with the 2003 concept). Competing against the Ford F-Series, Ram pickup, Toyota Tundra, and Nissan Titan, the Silverado is among the best-selling vehicles in the United States, having sold over 12 million trucks since its introduction in 1998 as a 1999 model year.[2]\nHistory[edit]\nThe Silverado nameplate made its debut for the 1975 model year, becoming the top trim level on all Chevrolet C/K trucks,[3] slotted above Custom Deluxe, Scottsdale, and Cheyenne. For the 1968 model year (seven years before the Silverado), GMC C/K trucks used variations of the Sierra name (Sierra, Sierra Classic, Sierra Grande, and High Sierra). Even after the C/K series officially ended, GM still uses the CK and the CC in their current model codes, to denote a two-wheel drive (CC), and four-wheel drive (CK).[4]\nFor the 1988 GMT400 model architecture, Chevrolet retained the C/K model nomenclature, with GMC branding its full-size line as Sierras. While sharing the same body and chassis, the model chronology of the Silverado and Sierra are different, with five generations of the Sierra, while four of the Silverado.\nIn 2018, at the NTEA Work Truck Show in Indianapolis, Indiana, Chevrolet unveiled the first medium-duty Silverado, expanding the model line to a 4500HD, 5500HD, and 6500HD chassis cab. Largely the successor to the 2003\u20132009 GMT560 chassis, the medium-duty trucks are exclusive to Chevrolet, with no plans for an equivalent GMC version. Instead, Navistar International (now partnering with GM) would sell the medium-duty trucks as a rebadged counterpart, called the CV. This is in fact a very similar nod to how the Avalanche did not have a GMC Yukon\u2013based equivalent, but instead, Cadillac would take its place as the former's rebadged counterpart, the Escalade EXT.\nFirst-generation Silverado / second-generation Sierra (GMT800; 1999)[edit]\nMain article: Chevrolet Silverado (first generation)\nFirst-generation Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD (2001\u201302 Regular Cab)\nThe GMT800 Silverado/Sierra 1500 and 2500 pickup trucks were released in August 1998 as 1999 models. The \"classic\" light-duty GMT400 C/K trucks continued to be produced for the first two years alongside the new models, and the Heavy-Duty GMT400 pickups (alongside the GMT400 SUVs) were continued until 2000, with the new GMT800 Silverado/Sierra HD (Heavy Duty) released a year later. A 3500 model was added later for 2001, with the introduction of the HD moniker (though it was not until the 2007 GMT900 model year a 3500HD debuted).\nThe trucks were refreshed in 2002 for the 2003 model year, bringing slight design changes and an upgrade to the audio and HVAC controls. The 2007 GMT800 trucks, built after the new GMT900 entered production, used the name Classic to denote the difference between the two generations.\nSecond-generation Silverado / third-generation Sierra (GMT900; 2007)[edit]\nMain article: Chevrolet Silverado (second generation)\nThis section does not cite any sources.

(February 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\nThird-generation GMC Sierra crew cab\nThe GMT900 generation of the Silverado/Sierra arrived in the last quarter of 2006 as a 2007 model. It features a redesigned exterior, interior, frame, and suspension as well as power increases on certain engines. Like the previous generation GMT800's and earlier C/K lines, it takes many styling cues from the GMT900 SUVs of the same year. Like the GMT900 SUVs, these pickups have improved aerodynamics over their predecessors thanks to steeply raked windshields and tighter panel gaps which help improve fuel economy. The previous GMT800 models were continued through 2007 badged as \"Classic,\" just as the GMT400 models continued for two years after the GMT800's introduction.\nThe new Silverado earned the North American Truck of the Year award for 2007 and was Motor Trend magazine's Truck of the Year for 2007.\nProduction continued until 2013.\nThird-generation Silverado / fourth-generation Sierra (GMT K2XX; 2014)[edit]\nThird generation\n2014 Silverado LTZ Crew Cab 4\u00d74\nOverview\nAlso\u00a0called \nChevrolet Silverado LD/GMC Sierra Limited (2019)\nProduction\n2013\u20132018 (1500)\n2014\u20132019 (HD)\n2018 (LD)\nModel\u00a0years \n2014\u20132018 (1500)\n2019 (1500 LD)\n2015\u20132019 (HD)\nAssembly  \nUnited States: Roanoke, Indiana (Fort Wayne Assembly); Flint, Michigan (Flint Truck Assembly)\nCanada: Oshawa, Ontario (Oshawa Car Assembly)\nMexico: Silao, Guanajuato (Silao Assembly)\nAustralia: Melbourne, Victoria (GM-Holden, RHD remanufacturing)\nDesigner    Kevin O'Donnell (2010)[5]\nBody and chassis\nPlatform    GMT K2XX\nPowertrain\nEngine  1500:\nLV3 EcoTec3 4.3 L V6 285\u00a0hp (213\u00a0kW; 289\u00a0PS)[6]\nL83 EcoTec3 5.3 L V8 355\u00a0hp (265\u00a0kW; 360\u00a0PS) (365\u00a0hp (272\u00a0kW; 370\u00a0PS) for Sierra All Terrain X)[6]\nL8B EcoTec3 5.3 L V8 355\u00a0hp (265\u00a0kW; 360\u00a0PS)[7]\nL86 EcoTec3 6.2 L V8 420\u00a0hp (313\u00a0kW; 426\u00a0PS)[6]\nHD:\nLY6 Vortec 6000 6.0 L V8 360\u00a0hp (268\u00a0kW; 365\u00a0PS)\nLML Duramax 6.6 L V8 (2015-16) 397\u00a0hp (296\u00a0kW; 403\u00a0PS)\nL5P Duramax 6.6 L V8 (2017-20) 445\u00a0hp (332\u00a0kW; 451\u00a0PS)\nTransmission    6-speed 6L80 automatic[6]\n6-speed 6L90 automatic\n8-speed 8L90 automatic\n6-speed Allison 1000 automatic[8]\nBattery 0.45 kWh lithium-ion (eAssist mild hybrid)\nDimensions\nWheelbase   Regular 6'6\": 119\u00a0in (3,023\u00a0mm)\nRegular 8': 133\u00a0in (3,378\u00a0mm)\nDouble 6'6\" & Crew 5'5\": 143.5\u00a0in (3,645\u00a0mm)\nCrew 6'6\": 153\u00a0in (3,886\u00a0mm)\nCrew 8': 167\u00a0in (4,242\u00a0mm)\nLength  Regular 6'6\": 205.6\u00a0in (5,222\u00a0mm)\nRegular 8': 224.4\u00a0in (5,700\u00a0mm)\nDouble & Crew 5'5\": 230\u00a0in (5,842\u00a0mm)\nCrew 6'6\": 239.6\u00a0in (6,086\u00a0mm)\nCrew 8': 258.3\u00a0in (6,561\u00a0mm)\nWidth   80\u00a0in (2,032\u00a0mm)\nHeight  73.5\u00a0in (1,867\u00a0mm) \u2013 74.2\u00a0in (1,885\u00a0mm)\nCurb\u00a0weight \n4,696\u20134,948\u00a0lb (2,130\u20132,244\u00a0kg) (Regular Cab)\n4,982\u20135,232\u00a0lb (2,260\u20132,373\u00a0kg) (Double Cab)\n5,036\u20135,300\u00a0lb (2,284\u20132,404\u00a0kg) (Crew Cab)\n[9]\nChronology\nPredecessor Cadillac Escalade EXT (for High Country)\nA blue 2014 Silverado LTZ Crew Cab 4\u00d74 similar to Steve McGarrett's truck from Hawaii Five-0; in the \"Kupu-eu\" episode\n2014 Silverado LTZ Double Cab 4\u00d74\nOn December 13, 2012, the fully-redesigned 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra were both introduced in Detroit, Michigan, later making their public debut at the North American International Auto Show. GM has now dropped the GMT900 platform, becoming \"K2XX.\" This generation of the Silverado/Sierra 1500 has three all-new gasoline engine options: a 4.3L EcoTec3 V6, a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8, and a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8, while dropping the 4.8L Vortec V8 from the last generation. Chevrolet's MyLink touch-screen multimedia interface system became available on most models. It included A2DP stereo streaming technologies, Bluetooth hands-free telephone, USB hookups, and an input for an Apple iPod or iPhone. A Bose premium audio system, as well as a Bose surround sound audio system, was available on most models. OnStar became standard on all models.\nUnderneath, the Silverado rides on a fully boxed high-strength steel frame with hydroforming technology; truck cab's frame is built with high strength steel as well. The third generation Silverado uses aluminum on the hood, for the engine block and for the control arms in order to save mass. The truck's bed is made of roll-formed steel instead of stamped steel used by other manufacturers in order to save weight and gain strength. The third generation Silverado introduced the all-new upmarket top-of-the-line \"High Country\" trim level which includes saddle brown leather interior, which is Chevrolet's very first entry into the luxury truck market since the 1955\u20131959 Task-Force 3100 \"Cameo Carrier.\" A fully-squared front fascia takes retro-modern styling cues from the GMT400 and 1981\u20131987 Square-Body trucks, and on Z71 models, a Z71 badge was added to the bottom right place of the grille. The first production Silverado completed assembly on April 29, 2013. The Silverado 1500 went on sale in May 2013 as a 2014 model, with the Silverado HD being available in early 2014 for the 2015 model year. On January 10, 2014, a recall was issued for 370,000 Silverado and Sierra pickups over a fire risk.[10]\nIn the U.S., the 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and 2015 2500HD/3500HD (as well as the latter's 2015 High Country) were introduced to the Philippines market by Chevrolet Motorama Show in late November 2014 for MY2015, along with the MY2015 Suburban, Tahoe, Impala, Express, Trax, and Colorado.\nOn January 14, 2014, the Silverado, along with the Corvette Stingray, received the 2014 North American International Auto Show's Car and Truck of the Year awards, respectively.[11]\nFor 2018, this generation of Silverado was officially exported to Australia and converted to right-hand-drive and Australian Design Rules (ADR) by General Motors Australian subsidiary, Holden Special Vehicles (HSV). In the past, several independent specialists imported and converted Silverados and Sierras for Australian and right-hand-drive markets. Only 2500HD and 3500HD models equipped with 6.6L Duramax diesel option were available. Neither gasoline engines nor 1500 series trucks were offered.[12][13]\n2015[edit]\nFor the 2015 model year, the 6.2L EcoTec3 is now paired with the new 8-speed 8L90 transmission, offering a wider ratio spread with more closely spaced gears, quicker shifts, improved acceleration, and fuel economy.[14] The Silverado 2500HD/3500HD models carried over the 6.0L L96 flex-fuel capable Vortec engine combined with the 6L90E transmission, installed with engine oil and transmission fluid coolers for hauling/towing applications. The 6.6L Duramax also continued to be backed by the 6-speed Allison 1000 automatic.[8][15] The 1500 Regular Cab Long Box model also became available from the factory without a pickup bed (i.e., as a chassis cab).[16] GM last offered its half-ton trucks as chassis cabs in 1980.\nThe GMC Sierra 2500HD/3500HD were the first \"heavy-duty\" trucks to offer an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), a Forward Collision Warning System (FCWS), and a Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS) available together as part of the available Driver Assist Package. The Driver Assist Package was standard equipment on the GMC Sierra 2500HD/3500HD Denali, and optional on most other Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD/3500HD and GMC Sierra 2500HD/3500HD models. Other new options for the Silverado and Sierra 2500HD/3500HD models included an eight-inch, full-color, reconfigurable LCD Driver Information Center (DIC) screen (for Sierra 2500HD/3500HD Denali models only), a 110-volt AC household-style power outlet, up to six available USB ports, an available eight-inch touchscreen infotainment system, and a power-sliding rear window with integrated defroster.\nIn mid-year 2015, Chevrolet and GMC made enhancements to the all-new Silverado 2500HD/3500HD and Sierra 2500HD/3500HD. Some of these enhancements included a new OnStar telematics system with 4G LTE Wi-Fi capabilities, new wheel designs, new exterior paint color options, new exterior tow mirror designs, a USB port added the glove compartment of trucks equipped with a front bench seat, DURALIFE brake rotors, the availability of dual 150 and 220 amp alternators for models equipped with the 6.6-liter Duramax Turbodiesel V8 engine, an off-road information screen added to the instrument cluster of 4\u00d74 models equipped with the Z71 or All-Terrain Packages (the latter is a GMC-only option), a Bi-Fi Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) option for models equipped with the 6.0L Vortec gasoline V8 engine, a new All-Terrain Package available on SLE and SLT Double Cab and Crew Cab models (for GMC models only), a standard heavy-duty locking rear axle for all models, and the removal of HD Radio from the \"up-level\" IO5 and IO6 infotainment systems. A Regular Production Option (RPO) Code of \"AVF\" in the upper glove compartment distinguishes early-build 2015 models from their 2015.5 successors.[17]\nSpecial Editions[edit]\nFor 2015, Chevrolet introduced a Special Edition for the Silverado truck series. They are in the following series of Rally Edition 1 and 2, Midnight Edition, Custom Sport Edition, Custom Sport Plus Edition, Black Out Edition, and Texas Edition.[18]\nRally Edition 1\nRally Edition 2\nBlack Out Edition\nTexas Edition\n2016 mid-cycle refresh[edit]\n2016 Chevrolet Silverado LTZ Z71\n2017 Chevrolet Silverado LT rear\nFor 2016, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 received a mid-cycle refresh. The refreshed Silverado and Sierra received a new grille, headlights, and front fascia, with design influences from the 2015 Chevrolet Colorado, as well as all-new LED taillights on the 2016 Silverado LTZ and High Country, 2016 GMC Sierra SLT and Denali trim levels while the 2016 Chevy Silverado LT trim levels and below still have the pre-facelifted incandescent taillights along with the 2016 GMC Sierra SLE trim levels and below. Silverado 1500 LTZ and High Country, as well as Sierra 1500 SLT and Denali models equipped with LED headlights, can be optioned with the Intellibeam high beam assist system. On October 1, 2015, HD Radio was added to the Silverado and Sierra to their 8-inch MyLink system as standard equipment on the LT and LTZ trims, while the Sierra included the feature in its IntelliLink system as standard on all its trims. 2016 Silverado and Sierra models optioned with the 8-inch touch screen featured Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability. Trucks ordered with bucket seats and center console now featured a wireless charging pad on the console lid.[19] New color options for the Silverado included Iridescent Pearl Tricoat (1500 only), Autumn Bronze Metallic, Siren Red Tintcoat, and Red Hot, while the Sierra's new colors included White Frost Tricoat (also 1500 only), Mahogany Metallic, Crimson Red Tintcoat, and Cardinal Red.\nChevrolet Special Edition[edit]\nFor that year, Chevrolet has added and dropped some of the Special Editions for the Silverado truck series. They are in the following series of Rally Edition 1 and 2, Midnight HD Edition, Midnight Edition, Custom Sport HD Edition, Realtree Edition, Custom Sport HD Edition, and Special Ops Edition.[18]\nCustom Sport HD Edition\nBlackout Edition\nMidnight HD edition\n2017[edit]\nFor the 2017 model year, Silverado and Sierra HD models were introduced with a new 6.6L Duramax turbo-diesel V8 (L5P) and received a new hood with air intake vents. Gasoline-powered models now have a capless fuel filler. The Sierra HD now included standard HID headlamps on all trim levels. New colors included Graphite Metallic and Pepperdust Metallic (Silverado) or Dark Slate Metallic and Pepperdust Metallic (Sierra). Jet Black/Medium Ash Gray interior trim is added for Silverado High Country. Low-speed mitigation braking is added to the Driver Alert Package for both Silverado and Sierra.[20]\nAll Silverado and Sierra models received minor changes to their MyLink (Chevrolet) and IntelliLink (GMC) infotainment systems. The interior backlighting on GMC Sierras changed from red to blue-green (or teal). Silverado and Sierra Double and Crew Cabs also received several new safety features, including GM's Rear Seat Reminder[21] and Teen Driver Mode.[22]\neAssist Mild Hybrid[edit]\nStarting in 2016, GM offered an eAssist mild hybrid version of the 5.3L V8 engine in the Silverado LT and Sierra SLT, but only in the state of California. The engine came with an 8-speed automatic transmission and had the same horsepower and torque as the standard version.[23] For 2017, it was also available in Hawaii, Oregon, Texas, and Washington. For 2018, it became available nationwide and was also offered in the Silverado LTZ.[24]\nSilverado SSV[edit]\nIn late 2014, Chevrolet released the 2015 Silverado SSV (Special Service Vehicle) to complement its lineup of law enforcement vehicles. The SSV Silverado was available in the 1500 Crew Cab with either the short (5.5') or standard (6.5') box. The 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 was the only engine option, and the SSV was based on the WT trim. It featured beefier brake rotors, upgraded oil coolers, high-output alternator, auxiliary battery, and an upfitter-friendly interior.[25]\nSpecial editions[edit]\nGMC[edit]\nIn 2016, GMC introduced the Sierra All Terrain X, which is equipped with a 5.3L V8 engine with performance exhaust, increasing power from 355 to 365 horsepower (265 to 272\u00a0kW; 360 to 370\u00a0PS). On the exterior, the Sierra All Terrain X features black 18\" rims fitted with larger 265/65R18SL Goodyear Wrangler Duratrac MT tires, black bed-mounted sport bar, LED off-road lights, and blacked-out accents.[26]\nAfter introducing the Sierra 1500 All Terrain X and Canyon All Terrain X, GMC extended the same formula to its heavy-duty pickup family with the Sierra HD All Terrain X in 2017. It was available on four-wheel-drive 2500 HD crew cab models and came in either Black Onyx or Summit White exterior colors.\nAll Terrain X models had a body-color grille surround and a grille insert that was unique to the All Terrain. Body-color door handles, front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, and black accents, including belt moldings, front bumper skid plate, and B-pillar accents, gave it a monochromatic appearance.\nSierra HD All Terrain X models also included 18\" black-painted aluminum wheels\u2014fitted with LT275/65R18 Goodyear Duratrac MT-rated tires\u2014along with four-inch black sport side steps, black heated and power-folding trailering mirrors with integrated turn signals and LED guidance lamps, a spray-on bedliner, and a black bed-mounted sport bar, which was designed to support available LED off-road driving lamps from GMC Accessories.\nInside, the All Terrain X had the GMC IntelliLink infotainment system with an 8-inch-diagonal color touchscreen, Teen Driver, remote-locking tailgate, remote starting system, Rear Vision Camera, adjustable pedals, leather-trimmed seats, heated front seats, and wireless mobile device charging.\nA 6.0L gasoline V8 engine was standard, with the 6.6L Duramax turbo-diesel delivering 445 horsepower (332\u00a0kW; 451\u00a0PS) and 910\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (1,234\u00a0N\u22c5m; 126\u00a0kg\u22c5m) of torque being optional.\nThe Sierra HD All Terrain X also included the Z71 off-road suspension package, adding front underbody and transfer case skid plates, twin-tube Rancho shocks, hill descent control, and off-road information graphics in the Driver Information Center. An Eaton automatically locking rear differential (4.10:1) was also standard.[27]\n2017[edit]\nSpecial Edition[edit]\nChevrolet[edit]\nThere were several additions to this year's Special Editions for the Silverado series shown in boldface. They are the following series of Midnight, Midnight HD, Rally 1, Rally 2, High Desert, Custom Sport HD, Realtree, Special Ops, Alaskan (available on HD series only), Redline, and Black Out. The remaining Special Edition listed in the 2017 Chevrolet Silverado brochure were All Star Edition and Texas Edition.\nNew for 2017 was the High Desert option package (with a plastic roll-bar inspired by the Avalanche sport utility truck). This package brought a new innovative lockable storage system into the bed of the Silverado 1500 Crew Cab model. The system included a three-piece hard tonneau cover, dual lockable storage bins on each side of the truck bed, and a removable bed divider to keep items separate and from moving around the truck bed while the vehicle was in motion. The High Desert package was available on both two-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive LT, LTZ, and High Country trim levels. It was not available on LTZ models with the Z71 off-road package. LT models with the High Desert package receive the same LED taillamps as the LTZ and High Country trims. Magnetic Ride Control was optional on High Country High Desert.\nAll Star Edition\nHigh Country High Desert Edition\nRally 2 Edition\nRedline Edition\n2018[edit]\n2018 GMC Sierra 3500HD Denali DRW\nSpecial Edition[edit]\nTo commemorate the 100th anniversary of the first Chevrolet truck, GM introduced special-edition models of the Chevrolet Silverado and the smaller Chevrolet Colorado.[28]\nChevrolet[edit]\nChevrolet introduced the Centennial Edition Chevrolet Silverado for 2018. Only available in a Crew Cab Short Box configuration with the LTZ Z71 trim, the Centennial Edition added a model-exclusive Centennial Blue Metallic color option, 22\" painted-aluminum wheels with chrome inserts, and special \"100 Years\" Chevrolet Bowtie emblems.[28] In addition to the Centennial Edition, the remaining Silverado Special Editions were virtually unchanged from the last year model.[18][29][30]\nCentennial Edition\nSpecial Ops Edition\nHD Midnight Edition\n2019 Silverado LD/Sierra Limited[edit]\nChevrolet continued production of the third-generation Silverado 1500 for 2019, which was sold alongside the all-new, fourth-generation 2019 Silverado 1500. Renamed the Chevrolet Silverado LD (\"LD\" for Light Duty), production of the previous-generation truck moved from Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Oshawa Car Assembly, Ontario, Canada. Only available in Double Cab/Standard Box configuration and with the 5.3L V8 engine, the Silverado LD ended production in December 2019.[31]\nIn retrospect, the first-generation Chevrolet Silverado 1500 was sold alongside its predecessor\u2014the fourth-generation C/K 1500\u2014for 1999, with the predecessor only being available with the V8 gasoline engine, automatic transmission, and the three-door extended cab/short bed configuration. It was also sold alongside the new-style second-generation Silverado for the 2007 model year as the Silverado Classic. GMC also offered versions of their Sierra trucks as the Sierra Classic for 1999 and 2007 as well, and did the same for 2019, offering the predecessor generation model as the Sierra 1500 Limited.[32]\nEngines[edit]\nModel   Year    Engine  Power   Torque\n1500    2014\u20132018   4.3 L LV3 GM EcoTec3 4300 V6    285\u00a0hp (213\u00a0kW; 289\u00a0PS) at 5300\u00a0rpm 305\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (414\u00a0N\u22c5m; 42\u00a0kg\u22c5m) at 3900\u00a0rpm\n2014\u20132019   5.3L L83 GM EcoTec3 5300 V8 355\u00a0hp (265\u00a0kW; 360\u00a0PS) at 5600\u00a0rpm 383\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (519\u00a0N\u22c5m; 53\u00a0kg\u22c5m) at 4100\u00a0rpm\n2016\u20132018   5.3L L8B GM EcoTec3 5300 V8 (eAssist)   355\u00a0hp (265\u00a0kW; 360\u00a0PS) at 5600\u00a0rpm 383\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (519\u00a0N\u22c5m; 53\u00a0kg\u22c5m) at 4100\u00a0rpm\n2014\u20132018   6.2L L86 GM EcoTec3 6200 V8 420\u00a0hp (313\u00a0kW; 426\u00a0PS) at 5600\u00a0rpm 460\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (624\u00a0N\u22c5m; 64\u00a0kg\u22c5m) at 4100\u00a0rpm\nHD  2015\u20132019   6.0L L96 Vortec 6000 V8 360\u00a0hp (268\u00a0kW; 365\u00a0PS) at 5400\u00a0rpm 380\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (515\u00a0N\u22c5m; 53\u00a0kg\u22c5m) at 4400\u00a0rpm\n2015\u20132016   6.6L LML Duramax V8 397\u00a0hp (296\u00a0kW; 403\u00a0PS) at 3200\u00a0rpm 765\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (1,037\u00a0N\u22c5m; 106\u00a0kg\u22c5m) at 1600\u00a0rpm\n2017\u20132019   6.6L L5P Duramax V8 445\u00a0hp (332\u00a0kW; 451\u00a0PS) at 2800\u00a0rpm 910\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (1,234\u00a0N\u22c5m; 126\u00a0kg\u22c5m) at 1600\u00a0rpm\nFourth-generation Silverado / fifth-generation Sierra (GMT T1XX; 2019)[edit]\nFourth generation\nOverview\nAlso\u00a0called HSV Chevrolet Silverado (Australia)\nGMSV Chevrolet Silverado (Australia)\nProduction  July 2018 \u2013 present (1500)\nMay 2019[33] \u2013 present (2500, 3500)\nModel\u00a0years 2019\u2013present (1500)\n2020\u2013present (2500, 3500)\nAssembly  \nUnited States: Roanoke, Indiana (Fort Wayne Assembly); Flint, Michigan (Flint Truck Assembly)\nCanada: Oshawa, Ontario (Oshawa Car Assembly)\nMexico: Silao, Guanajuato (Silao Assembly)\nAustralia: Melbourne, Victoria (GMSV Australia, RHD remanufacturing)\nDesigner    Tyler Moffett (2015)[34]\nBody and chassis\nPlatform    GMT T1XX\nRelated Chevrolet Colorado (third generation)[35]\nPowertrain\nEngine  L3B 2.7L Turbocharged I4\nLV3 EcoTec3 4.3L V6 (2019\u20132021)\nL82 EcoTec3 5.3L V8 (2019-2021)\nL84 EcoTec3 5.3L V8\nL87 EcoTec3 6.2L V8\nLM2 Duramax Diesel 3.0L I6\nLZ0 Duramax Diesel 3.0L I6\nTransmission    6-speed MYC 6L80 Automatic (2019\u20132021)\n6-speed 6L90 automatic (2020-2023)\n8-speed 8L90 automatic\n10-speed Hydra-Matic 10L80 MF6 automatic\n10-speed Allison 10L1000 MGM/MGU automatic\nDimensions\nWheelbase \nRegular Cab: 126.5\u00a0in (3,213\u00a0mm)\nDouble/Crew Cab: 147.4\u00a0in (3,744\u00a0mm)\nLength\nRegular 6'6\": 210.7\u00a0in (5,352\u00a0mm)\nRegular 8': 229.5\u00a0in (5,829\u00a0mm)\nDouble: 231.8\u00a0in (5,888\u00a0mm)\nCrew 5'8\": 231.7\u00a0in (5,885\u00a0mm)\nCrew 6'6\": 241.2\u00a0in (6,126\u00a0mm)\nWidth   81.2\u00a0in (2,062\u00a0mm)\nHeight  75.4\u201375.8\u00a0in (1,920\u20131,930\u00a0mm)\n78.2\u201378.5\u00a0in (1,990\u20131,990\u00a0mm) (Trail Boss)\nCurb\u00a0weight Silverado 1500\n4,474\u20134,686\u00a0lb (2,029\u20132,126\u00a0kg) (Regular Cab)\n4,793\u20135,007\u00a0lb (2,174\u20132,271\u00a0kg) (Double Cab)\n4,798\u20135,008\u00a0lb (2,176\u20132,272\u00a0kg) (Crew Cab)\n[36]\nOn December 16, 2017, Chevrolet unveiled the all-new, fourth-generation 2019 Silverado 1500 at its Chevy Truck Centennial Celebration Weekend at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, Texas. The debut of the all-new Silverado was not expected until early 2018. For its debut, the Silverado 1500 was airlifted via a helicopter onto a stage, where it was introduced to a crowd of Chevrolet truck owners and enthusiasts, as well as to the automotive press. Chevrolet NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. also spoke at the event. In addition to the reveal of the 2019 Silverado 1500, multiple Chevrolet trucks of different generations were on display as well.[37]\nThe model shown at the reveal was the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LT Trail Boss, an all-new trim level added to the lineup, and is a factory-modified version of the Silverado 1500 LT Z71. Distinguishing features of the Trail Boss from other Silverado 1500 trim levels are its gloss black front fascia, black rear step bumper, black Chevrolet \"bow-tie\" emblems on the front grille and rear tailgate, 18-inch gloss black-finished aluminum-alloy wheels, large off-road tires, altered suspension, \"Trail Boss\" decals on the sides of the bed, front bumper-mounted center fog lamps, \"Z71\" emblems on each front fender, and red-painted front tow hooks.\nThe formal unveiling of the Silverado 1500 took place at the 2018 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan on January 13, 2018, exactly 100 years after Chevrolet delivered its first trucks to customers on January 13, 1918. The model was unveiled as a Silverado LT Trail Boss model.\nSales to customers began in August 2018 as an early 2019 model year vehicle with a base price of $32,200 MSRP.[38][39]\nThe Silverado 1500 features a more sculpted exterior design, with headlamps that integrate into the grille (similar to more recent Ford trucks), and the former also incorporates LED Daytime Running Accent Lamps (DRL's).[37] Coincidentally, both brought in an all-new 10-speed automatic transmission.\nFor the 2020 model year, the Silverado 1500 has been launched in Australia for the first time. Holden Special Vehicles (known as General Motors Specialty Vehicles since 2021) has started the conversion to right-hand-drive and Australian Design Rules. The 6.2L V8 engine is the sole engine choice at the launch.[40][41]\nTrims[edit]\nAs of 2019, the Silverado 1500 was planned to be available in eight distinct trim levels: WT, Custom, Custom Trail Boss, LT, RST, LT Trail Boss, LTZ, and High Country.[42]\nAll trim levels include a next-generation touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth for hands-free calling and wireless audio streaming via A2DP, power windows and door locks (on Double and Crew Cab models), air conditioning, and a rearview backup camera system. Additional features available on select trim levels include GPS navigation, SiriusXM Satellite Radio and Travel Link, OnStar with 4G LTE in-vehicle Wi-Fi, a Bose premium audio system with seven speakers, keyless access and push-button start, a remote starter system, heated and ventilated luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces, a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, driver-assist technologies, a multi-angle camera system, and heated rear seats.\nSpecial Editions[edit]\nFor 2020, the Rally and Midnight Special Editions returned after being absent for the 2019 model year. Rally Edition was available on the Silverado Custom and RST trims. The package featured black Rally Stripes on the hood and tailgate, black CHEVROLET tailgate lettering, and black assist steps. The Midnight Edition featured Bucket Seats with Console, special headlamp bezels, black dual exhaust tips, and black assist steps. The Midnight Edition was only available on the LT Trail Boss trim level.[43]\nAlso in 2020, Chevrolet and Realtree announced that there would be a 2021 Silverado 1500 Realtree Edition. This was the second time Chevrolet and Realtree teamed up to produce a special edition Silverado, having done so in 2016. The 2021 model was based on a Silverado 1500 Custom Trail Boss in Crew Cab Short Box configuration, adding 20-inch black wheels and Realtree camouflage graphics inside and out.[44] Ultimately, only seven examples came to exist to the public in the United States.[citation needed]\nEngines[edit]\nRear view\nInterior\nThe all-new 2019 Silverado and Sierra 1500 offers a choice of six different engine options, dependent upon trim level. The base engine on lower trim levels is the 285-horsepower (213\u00a0kW; 289\u00a0PS), 4.3-liter EcoTec3 E85-capable V6 gasoline engine. Standard on mid-level trims is an all-new, 310-horsepower (231\u00a0kW; 314\u00a0PS), 2.7-liter turbocharged inline-four gasoline engine (thus being the smallest engine available on a GM full-size half-ton pickup), and features cylinder deactivation for improved fuel economy. Optional on most trim levels is the 355-horsepower (265\u00a0kW; 360\u00a0PS), 5.3-liter EcoTec3 V8 gasoline engine, which is optionally E85 capable, and features either a carryover Active Fuel Management (AFM) system, or a brand-new Dynamic Fuel Management system (DFM), which now can shut off two, three, four, five, or six of eight cylinders. The availability of either AFM or DFM is dependent on trim level, with WT and Custom trucks available with AFM, and LT and above trucks standard with DFM. Optional on upper-level trims is a 420-horsepower (313\u00a0kW; 426\u00a0PS), 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V8 gasoline engine with Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM). An also all-new, 277-horsepower (207\u00a0kW; 281\u00a0PS) 3.0-liter turbocharged Duramax I6 engine became available for the 2020 model year. Availability of this engine had been delayed because of EPA certification. All engines are paired to either a 6-speed, 8-speed, or 10-speed automatic transmission, with a choice of either two-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive (the latter being standard equipment on Silverado 1500 Custom Trail Boss and LT Trail Boss trims, and optional on all other Silverado 1500 and Sierra 1500 models). For 2020, availability of both the 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V8 gasoline engine and the 10-speed automatic transmission will expand to most Silverado 1500 and Sierra 1500 trim levels.\nAccording to EPA ratings, 2WD 2019 Silverado models with the 2.7-liter turbo inline-4 engine can achieve 20\u00a0mpg\u2011US (12\u00a0L/100\u00a0km; 24\u00a0mpg\u2011imp; 8.5\u00a0km/L)/23\u00a0mpg\u2011US (10\u00a0L/100\u00a0km; 28\u00a0mpg\u2011imp; 9.8\u00a0km/L) city/highway.[45]\nModel   Year    Engine  Power   Torque\n1500    2019\u20132021   4.3 L LV3 GM EcoTec3 4300 V6    285\u00a0hp (213\u00a0kW; 289\u00a0PS) @ 5300 RPM  305\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (414\u00a0N\u22c5m; 42\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 3900 RPM\n2019\u20132021   2.7 L L3B Turbocharged I4   310\u00a0hp (231\u00a0kW; 314\u00a0PS) @ 5600 RPM  348\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (472\u00a0N\u22c5m; 48\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 1500 RPM\n2022\u2013   2.7 L L3B Turbocharged High Output I4   310\u00a0hp (231\u00a0kW; 314\u00a0PS) @ 5600 RPM  420\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (569\u00a0N\u22c5m; 58\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 1500 RPM\n2020\u20132022   3.0 L LM2 Duramax I6    277\u00a0hp (207\u00a0kW; 281\u00a0PS) @ 3750 RPM  460\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (624\u00a0N\u22c5m; 64\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 1500 RPM\n2023\u2013   3.0 L LZ0 Duramax I6    305\u00a0hp (227\u00a0kW; 309\u00a0PS) @ 3750 RPM  495\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (671\u00a0N\u22c5m; 68\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 1500 RPM\n2019\u20132021   5.3 L L82 GM EcoTec3 5300 V8    355\u00a0hp (265\u00a0kW; 360\u00a0PS) @ 5600 RPM  383\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (519\u00a0N\u22c5m; 53\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 4100 RPM\n2019\u2013   5.3 L L84 GM Ecotec3 5300 w/DFM V8  355\u00a0hp (265\u00a0kW; 360\u00a0PS) @ 5600 RPM  383\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (519\u00a0N\u22c5m; 53\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 4100 RPM\n2019\u2013   6.2 L L87 GM EcoTec3 6200 w/DFM V8  420\u00a0hp (313\u00a0kW; 426\u00a0PS) @ 5600 RPM  460\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (624\u00a0N\u22c5m; 64\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 4100 RPM\n2500HD/3500HD   2020\u2013   6.6 L L8T V8    401\u00a0hp (299\u00a0kW; 407\u00a0PS) @ 5200 RPM  464\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (629\u00a0N\u22c5m; 64\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 4000 RPM\n2020\u20132023   6.6 L L5P Duramax V8    445\u00a0hp (332\u00a0kW; 451\u00a0PS) @ 2800 RPM  910\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (1,234\u00a0N\u22c5m; 126\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 1600 RPM\n2024\u2013   6.6 L L5P Duramax V8    470\u00a0hp (350\u00a0kW; 477\u00a0PS) @ 2800 RPM  975\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (1,322\u00a0N\u22c5m; 135\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 1600 RPM\nInfotainment system[edit]\nStandard features include a next-generation infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The Waze mobile app can now be compatible in its infotainment system through the use of CarPlay.[46]\nA seven-inch infotainment system is standard on Chevrolet Silverado 1500 WT, Custom, and Custom Trail Boss models, as well as the GMC Sierra 1500 Base (Sierra) model, while an eight-inch infotainment system is standard on the Silverado 1500 LT, LT Trail Boss, RST, LTZ, and High Country models, as well as the Sierra 1500 SLE, SLT, AT4, and Denali. SiriusXM Satellite Radio, OnStar with 4G LTE Wi-Fi, a seven-speaker Bose premium audio system, HD Radio, GPS navigation, SiriusXM Travel Link, and a multi-angle camera system are all available depending upon the trim level selected. For 2020, Silverado and Sierra models add SiriusXM 360L compatibility.\nPayload and towing[edit]\nCrew cab Silverado models increased in payload by up to 14 percent, or 340 pounds (150\u00a0kg).[47]\nTrailering features equipped for the 2019 model included an industry-first VIN-specific trailering and payload label and an in-vehicle towing app on its GM infotainment system.[48]\nVariants[edit]\nChevrolet Silverado HD[edit]\nSilverado HD LTZ\nChevrolet released three all-new 2020 Silverado models, including the Silverado 2500 HD and 3500 HD, in 2019.[49] Chevrolet debuted the truck at GM's Flint, Michigan plant on February 5, 2019.[50][51] The trucks had made their arrival at the dealerships in the late summer of 2019.\nPayload and towing[edit]\nThe 2020 Silverado 3500 HD can tow up to 35,500 pounds (16,100\u00a0kg) in a regular cab dual rear wheel configuration with the Duramax 6.6L L5P turbodiesel V8 engine.[52]\nGMC Sierra[edit]\nThe fifth-generation GMC Sierra was unveiled in Detroit on March 1, 2018. The Sierra 1500 differentiates itself from its Chevrolet Silverado 1500 counterpart by offering unique features, such as a two-piece tailgate, a pickup bed constructed from carbon fiber, a 3-by-7-inch (7.6\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a017.8\u00a0cm) multi-color head-up display, a rearview mirror backup camera system, and a luxury Denali trim level. The Sierra 1500 also features its own distinct exterior styling, though interior styling is similar to that of the Chevrolet Silverado 1500.[53]\nThere are six functions of GMC Sierra's Multi-Pro Tailgate including a primary tailgate load stop for large items. Its inner tailgate can be a load stopper, a full-width step, and a work area by dropping down the load stop or provide easy access to the bed just by folding down the inner tailgate.[54]\nPowertrains include improved versions of the current 5.3-liter and 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V8 gasoline engines, as well as the same 3.0-liter Duramax turbocharged diesel I6 engine that is also available in the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500. An all-new, ten-speed automatic transmission comes as standard equipment on gasoline-powered Sierra 1500 models. Availability of the previous 4.3-liter EcoTec3 V6 gasoline engine was not announced at launch.\nAll trim levels included a next-generation touch screen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth for hands-free calling and wireless audio streaming via A2DP, power windows and door locks (on Double and Crew Cab models), air conditioning, and a rearview backup camera system. Additional features available on select trim levels included GPS navigation, SiriusXM Satellite Radio and Travel Link, OnStar with 4G LTE in-vehicle Wi-Fi, a Bose premium audio system with seven speakers, keyless access and push-button start, a remote starter system, heated and ventilated luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces, a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, driver-assist technologies, a multi-angle camera system, and heated rear seats.\nThe 2019 GMC Sierra went on sale in September 2018 as an early 2019 model year vehicle at GMC dealerships nationwide. The Sierra 1500 will be planning to launch in Australia and New Zealand in the 3rd Quarter of 2024 and assembled in GMSV Australia RHD Conversion.[55]\nSierra 1500 SLE\nSierra 1500 SLE rear\nSierra 1500 AT4\nSierra 1500 Denali interior\nSierra 2500 Denali\nSierra 2500 Denali rear\nRegular Cab[edit]\nNot initially available at launch, the all-new 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 regular cab configuration went on sale in early 2019. Initially only available with an 8-foot (2.4\u00a0m) pickup box, with a choice of two-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive and the 4.3-liter EcoTec3 V6 or 5.3-liter V8 gasoline engines, the regular cab is exclusively available in the WT trim (1WT) for Silverado 1500, or the Sierra (1SA) trim for Sierra 1500. The regular cab option is not available in other trim levels in the United States and Canada, as these trucks are geared mainly towards fleet and commercial buyers. Although regular cab models with a 6.5-foot (2.0\u00a0m) bed and in higher trim levels actually are produced, they are only available for sale in Mexico and the Middle East. Starting in 2022, regular cab models with a 6.5-foot (2.0\u00a0m) bed were made available in the United States and Canada, albeit only in WT trim and with the 2.7L L4 engine.\nStandard features include a black front grille, black front and rear bumpers, 17\" steel wheels, manual windows and door locks, manual black side mirrors, a seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with rearview backup camera and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, vinyl seating surfaces, a split front bench seat, vinyl flooring, and air conditioning. Options include the Chrome Appearance Group (17\" aluminum-alloy wheels and chrome front and rear bumpers), OnStar 4G LTE in-vehicle Wi-Fi capabilities, cloth seating surfaces, carpeted flooring with floor mats, and the Power Equipment Group (power windows and door locks, keyless entry, power black side mirrors, and cruise control).[56]\nThe 1500 Regular Cab Long Box model is also available from the factory without a bed (i.e., as a chassis cab). GM last offered its half-ton trucks as chassis cabs in 1980. [citation needed]\n2020 changes[edit]\nThe 2020 Silverado saw the deletion of the Oakwood Metallic exterior paint color. Aside from the 3.0 L Duramax, major additions were new vertical trailering mirrors, which include power adjustability, as well as power-folding and power-extension capabilities. Adaptive cruise control was optional on the LTZ and High Country trim levels, and SiriusXM 360L capability was available on LT and higher trims. The Silverado 1500 also deleted the keyless access buttons on the rear doors.\nThe Sierra saw a new Carbon Black Metallic paint color in addition to the above-mentioned Silverado updates.\n2020 was the final model year for 1500 Double Cab models in LTZ, SLT, and AT4 trims.\n2021 changes[edit]\nFor 2021, the Silverado and Sierra pickups saw relatively few changes. Most notably, the Silverado 1500 offered the newly named Multi-Flex six-position tailgate, which was borrowed from the GMC Sierra, and the introduction of wireless CarPlay and Android Auto projection capability. The 2.7-liter 4-cylinder and 3.0-liter Duramax diesel\u2013equipped Silverado and Sierra models saw increased towing capacity ratings and new towing technology, including a jack-knife alert and trailer length indicator. Several colors were changed on the Silverado: Havana Brown Metallic and Cajun Red Tintcoat were replaced by Oxford Brown Metallic and Cherry Red Tintcoat, respectively, and Mosaic Black Metallic is a new addition. 2021 Sierra models received color changes as well; Deep Mahogany Metallic, Red Quartz Tintcoat, and Carbon Black Metallic are replaced with Brownstone Metallic, Cayenne Red Tintcoat, and Ebony Twilight Metallic, respectively. Smokey Quartz Metallic was removed from the available color options and Hunter Metallic was added as a new paint color. For the 2021 Sierra, the previously unnamed \"Sierra\" trim officially became \"Pro.\"\nForward Collision Alert, Automatic Emergency Braking, and Front Pedestrian Braking options were now available on Silverado WT and Custom trim levels as part of the Safety Confidence Package. Crew Cab Standard Box Sierra 1500 models were now only available in four wheel drive.[57]\nSilverado and Sierra 3500 HD DRW models saw an increase in maximum towing capacity to 36,000 pounds (16,000\u00a0kg).[58]\nDue to the global microchip shortage, some 2021 Silverado and Sierra vehicles were built without options like automatic start-stop and heated and ventilated front seats, heated outboard rear seats, and heated steering wheel.[59]\n2022 changes[edit]\nThe 2022 Silverado LTD and Sierra Limited entered the model lineup as a stop-gap measure until production of the newly-refreshed 2022 model began. As such, the 2022 Silverado LTD and Sierra Limited had very few changes from the 2021 models.\nNotable changes for the 2022 Limited models included the discontinuation of both the 4.3-liter LV3 EcoTec3 V6 and 5.3-liter L82 EcoTec3 V8 with active fuel management (AFM) gasoline engines, as well as the previous \"6L80\" six-speed automatic transmission, leaving only the 8-speed and 10-speed available. The LT Trail Boss trim-level (Chevrolet) was now available with the 3.0-liter Duramax turbodiesel engine.[60] The 5.3L V8 is now no longer available on the Sierra 1500 Limited AT4.\n2022 refresh[edit]\nFor the 2022 model year, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 receives a mid-cycle refresh that includes the following new trim levels for the Chevrolet Silverado, called the ZR2, and for the GMC Sierra, called the AT4X and Denali Ultimate. The refresh also includes a new front-end design, as well as a revised interior. All trucks equipped with front bucket seats receive a new center console-mounted transmission shift lever (trucks equipped with a front bench seat retain the previous column-mounted gear selector lever). The 3.0-liter Duramax turbocharged diesel engine now has expanded availability on more trim levels. The 5.3L V8 is not available on Sierra 1500 AT4 models once again.\nThe short 6.5-foot (2.0\u00a0m) pickup box option has returned for the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 Regular Cabs since last being offered in the US market on the previous generation from 2018. The current generation version, which was previously only available in Mexico and the Middle East, is only available in the U.S. market with the WT and Pro trims of the Silverado and Sierra, respectively. Other trim levels like RST and Trail Boss for the Silverado and Elevation and AT4 for the Sierra have been available with this configuration in the Middle East since 2019 but are not offered in the U.S. Base Silverado 1500 WT and Sierra 1500 Pro Regular Cab models now received standard power windows, door locks, and push-button start,[61] although keyless entry remained an extra-cost option. All models from the LT (Silverado) and SLE (Sierra) and above received a newly standard 13.4-inch touchscreen infotainment system, which included wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration and SiriusXM Satellite Radio with 360L (up-level models also receive connected GPS navigation), while base models retained the previously-standard seven-inch touchscreen display. A new Silverado 1500 ZR2 model became the most off-road capable model in the lineup, while a new Sierra 1500 Denali Ultimate was now the top-tier trim of the lineup, which also received a new premium Bose surround sound audio system with an amplifier, subwoofer, and genuine metal speaker grilles. Top-tier Silverado and Sierra models received the General Motors Super Cruise semi-autonomous driving system, allowing for hands-free driving on most highways, and all models received more standard safety equipment.\nChevrolet also introduced a new trim level to this series, the ZR2, which slotted between High Country and LTZ.[62][63] GMC models receive a similar, though more upscale model known as AT4X.[64]\nThe refreshed 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 began shipping to dealerships in the spring of 2022. Both brands also sold the outgoing models of both trucks, named the Silverado 1500 LTD and Sierra 1500 Limited respectively, alongside the new models. Only 1500 (half-ton) models of both trucks were refreshed for 2022, with a refresh of the heavy-duty (2500HD and 3500HD) trucks following in 2024.\nIn April 2023, GM introduced the 2500HD version of the ZR2, a new heavy-duty off-road model, as well as a special edition called the ZR2 Bison, in partnership with parts supplier American Expedition Vehicles. CNBC noted it was another sign of a trend where automakers grew their off-road models to increase profits.[65]\n2022 Silverado 1500 LTZ front\n2022 Silverado 1500 LTZ rear\n2022 Silverado 1500 interior\n2024 Sierra 1500 Elevation front\n2022 Sierra 1500 Elevation rear\n2022 Sierra 1500 interior (standard)\n2022 Sierra 1500 interior (Denali Ultimate)\nSafety[edit]\nSitting higher than other consumer vehicles, the Chevrolet Silverado has significantly larger blind spots in which people or other cars are invisible to the driver.[66] According to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Silverado is the second most likely car to be involved in a fatal crash.[67]\nThe 2022 Silverado 1500 LTD Crew Cab was tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS):\nIIHS Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LTD Crew Cab:[68]\nCategory    Rating\nSmall overlap frontal offset (Driver)   Good\nSmall overlap frontal offset (Passenger)    Marginal\nModerate overlap frontal offset Good\nSide impact (original test) Good\nRoof strength   Good\nHead restraints and seats   Good\nHeadlights  Poor\nFront crash prevention (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) Superior    optional\nSeat belt reminders Poor\nChild seat anchors (LATCH) ease of use  Marginal\nSilverado EV[edit]\nMain article: Chevrolet Silverado EV\nIn April 2021, GM President Mark Reuss announced Chevrolet would be building an electric variant of the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 pickup truck at the Factory ZERO complex in Detroit. The vehicle will have a targeted range of 400 miles.[69] The vehicle was unveiled in January 2022 at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The vehicle has been built from the ground up as a fully electric pickup by using a battery electric platform shared with the GMC Hummer EV, instead of using the existing Silverado platform.[70] Production will start in the Factory ZERO assembly plant (formerly Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly) in the second quarter of 2023.[71]\nMedium duty version (4500HD, 5500HD, 6500HD, and International CV)[edit]\nMedium duty\nOverview\nAlso\u00a0called Chevrolet Silverado MD\nInternational CV\nProduction  2018\u2013present\nModel\u00a0years 2019\u2013present\nAssembly    Springfield, Ohio (Navistar)\nPowertrain\nEngine  L5D Duramax Diesel 6.6 L V8[72]\nTransmission    6-speed Allison A1700/A2700 automatic[72]\nDimensions\nWheelbase \nRegular Cab: 141\u2013243\u00a0in (3,581\u20136,172\u00a0mm)\nDouble/Crew Cab: 175\u2013235\u00a0in (4,445\u20135,969\u00a0mm)\n[72]\nLength\nRegular Cab: 224.5\u2013360.0\u00a0in (5,702\u20139,144\u00a0mm)\nCrew Cab: 258.7\u2013344.2\u00a0in (6,571\u20138,743\u00a0mm)\n[72]\nWidth   84.0\u00a0in (2,134\u00a0mm)[72]\nHeight  82.5\u201386.4\u00a0in (2,100\u20132,190\u00a0mm)[72]\nCurb\u00a0weight \n4500HD: 7,507\u20138,815\u00a0lb (3,405\u20133,998\u00a0kg)\n5500HD: 7,507\u20138,814\u00a0lb (3,405\u20133,998\u00a0kg)\n6500HD: 7,560\u20139,307\u00a0lb (3,429\u20134,222\u00a0kg)\n[72]\nFor the 2019 model year,[73] General Motors released the medium-duty Silverado 4500HD/5500HD/6500HD, joining the Chevrolet LCF 3500/4500/5500 model line (derived from the Isuzu NPR) and succeeding the prior Chevrolet Kodiak and GMC TopKick. Competing against the Ford F-450/550/650 and Ram 4500/5500, the model line spans Class 4\u20136 trucks, with GVWR ranging from 14,001 to 23,500\u00a0lb (6,351 to 10,659\u00a0kg).[74] Unlike the previous Kodiak/TopKick line, which was discontinued in 2009, GM markets the medium-duty Silverado line exclusively as a Chevrolet with no GMC equivalent;[75] along with a lack of divisional support for the segment, GM is seeking to rebrand the current GMC line as premium vehicles.\nHistory[edit]\nThe medium-duty Silverado was co-developed with Navistar, which sells a rebadged variant as the International CV (Commercial Vocational); the CV replaces the International D series and as well as the International TerraStar.[76] GM developed the powertrain, while Navistar was responsible for the chassis.[77] With the exception of grilles and badging, both model lines are identical. Navistar assembles both lines at its Springfield, Ohio facility,[78] using cabs assembled by Navistar in Springfield.[79]\nGM unveiled the medium-duty Silverado line at the NTEA Work Truck Show in March 2018.[80][81] Navistar unveiled the CV Series that November,[77] and production began in December.[82]\nDesign[edit]\nIn contrast to smaller Silverado pickup trucks, the 4500HD/5500HD/6500HD and CV are only offered as a chassis cab vehicle intended for modification by upfitters/body builders, typically by adding specialized rear bodywork. The frame rails have been designed to ease installation for upfitters.[83] It is marketed with two-door or four-door cabs and either rear-wheel or four-wheel drive, using a gear-driven transfer case. The hood tilts forward for easier access to the engine and for routine service.[76] GM have designated the model as the GM515 or GM51P, depending on the end use, with the GM51P used for incomplete passenger bus chassis.[84]\nBoth the Silverado medium-duty and CV are powered by a 350 horsepower (260\u00a0kW), 700\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (950\u00a0N\u22c5m) variant of the Duramax 6.6L V8 diesel engine[83] paired with an Allison 1000 or 2000 series automatic transmission.[85][86] There is also a diesel exhaust fluid filling port by the passenger's side door.[76]\nAvailable wheelbase and cab-to-axle dimensions[84][87]\nCab-to-axle Body    Wheelbase   Overhang\nFront   Rear 49\u00a0in (1,245\u00a0mm)   Rear 63\u00a0in (1,600\u00a0mm)   Rear 75\u00a0in (1,905\u00a0mm)   Rear 91\u00a0in (2,311\u00a0mm)\n60\u00a0in (1,524\u00a0mm)    Regular Cab 141\u00a0in (3,581\u00a0mm) (standard 2WD)    34\u00a0in (864\u00a0mm)   Yes     Yes     No  Yes\nCrew Cab    175\u00a0in (4,445\u00a0mm) (standard)     Yes     No  No  No\n84\u00a0in (2,134\u00a0mm)    Regular Cab 165\u00a0in (4,191\u00a0mm) (standard 4WD)     Yes     Yes     No  Yes\nCrew Cab    199\u00a0in (5,055\u00a0mm)    Yes     Yes     No  No\n104\u00a0in (2,642\u00a0mm)   Crew Cab    219\u00a0in (5,563\u00a0mm)    No  No  Yes     No\n108\u00a0in (2,743\u00a0mm)   Regular Cab 189\u00a0in (4,801\u00a0mm)    Yes     Yes     Yes     No\n120\u00a0in (3,048\u00a0mm)   Regular Cab 201\u00a0in (5,105\u00a0mm)    Yes     Yes     Yes     No\nCrew Cab    235\u00a0in (5,969\u00a0mm)    No  No  Yes     No\n138\u00a0in (3,505\u00a0mm)   Regular Cab 219\u00a0in (5,563\u00a0mm)    No  Yes     No  No\n150\u00a0in (3,810\u00a0mm)   Regular Cab 231\u00a0in (5,867\u00a0mm)    No  No  No  Yes\n162\u00a0in (4,115\u00a0mm)   Regular Cab 243\u00a0in (6,172\u00a0mm)    No  No  Yes     No\nThe front wheels can turn by up to 50 degrees to enhance maneuverability.[76]\nSales[edit]\nAt its launch, GM introduced the model line primarily through its dealer network that specialized in fleet and commercial truck sales, known as the 'Business Elite' program, alongside an additional limited number of selected dealerships.[88]\nSilverado 6500HD with dump bed\nInternational CV\nMilitary applications[edit]\nLSSV\nOverview\nManufacturer    General Motors\nAM General\nModel\u00a0years 2001\u2013present\nBody and chassis\nBody\u00a0style  2-door SUV\n4-door SUV\n2-door pickup\n4-door pickup\nPlatform    GM GMT880 platform\nPowertrain\nEngine  6.6 L Duramax V8\nTransmission    4-speed 4L80-E automatic\n5-speed Allison 1000 automatic\nDimensions\nWidth   79.9\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m)\nHeight  74.5\u00a0in (1.89\u00a0m)\nLSSV[edit]\nWhen production of the CUCV II ended in 2000, GM redesigned it to coincide with civilian truck offerings. The CUCV nomenclature was changed to Light Service Support Vehicle (LSSV) in 2001. In 2005, LSSV production switched to AM General, a unit of MacAndrews and Forbes Holdings. The LSSV is a GM-built Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD, Chevrolet Tahoe, or Chevrolet Suburban that is powered by a Duramax 6.6 liter turbo diesel engine. The various Silverados, Tahoes, and Suburbans that are used provide numerous platforms for different kinds of vehicles. As GM has redesigned its civilian trucks and SUVs from 2001\u2013present, LSSVs have also been updated cosmetically.[89]\nThe Militarization of standard GM trucks/SUVs to become LSSVs includes exterior changes such as CARC paint (Forest Green, Desert Sand, or 3-color Camouflage), blackout lights, military bumpers, a brush guard, a NATO slave receptacle/NATO trailer receptacle, a pintle hook and tow shackles. The electrical system is changed to the 24/12-volt military standard. The dashboard has additional controls and data plates. The truck also can be equipped with weapon supports in the cab, cargo tie down hooks, folding troop seats, pioneer tools, winches, and other military accessories.[89]\nThe Enhanced Mobility Package (EMP) option adds enhanced suspension, 4-wheel anti-lock brakes, a locking differential, on/off-road bead-lock tires, a tire pressure monitoring system and other upgrades. About 2,000 LSSV units were sold to U.S. and international military and law enforcement organizations.[89]\nVariants[edit]\nCargo/Troop Carrier Pickup (2-door, Extended Cab, or 4-door Silverado)\nCargo/Command Vehicle (4-door Tahoe)\nCargo/Troop/Command Vehicle/Ambulance (4-door Suburban)\nZH2[edit]\nZH2 Chevrolet Silverado\nOverview\nManufacturer    General Motors\nModel\u00a0years 2018\u2013present\nBody and chassis\nBody\u00a0style  2-door pickup\nPowertrain\nEngine  GM Hydrotec Fuel Cell Electric\nGeneral Motors relaunched the GM Defense division in 2018 offering the ZH2 Silverado, an advanced technology Chevrolet Silverado with a hydrogen-powered fuel cell and a heavy-duty truck architecture modified for next generation military vehicle needs.
