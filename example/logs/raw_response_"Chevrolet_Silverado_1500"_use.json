So far, my only complaints are the lack of Tune Select on XM and no place designed to hold my glasses (I had a drop-down in my Yukon, at the back of the overhead console). The latter is a minor thing.

I think the Ford has the most comfortable interior, the TRX has the best looking and the chevy has the most functional and user friendly.  \nI see where the ZR2 could improve the colors and some of the materials, but for the type pickup it is I think it's fine. we have about 3k miles on it now and I would buy it again.\n\n\n\nReactions: MO_ZR2, securityguy, scubatech and 2 others\n\nZR2NYC\nMar 11, 2023\n2,126\n3,929\n\n\nMay 19, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n#10\n\n\nBussman said:\nSo far I can say that I\u2019ll never own another truck but my 24 ZR2.

Evidently, my right foot contains a fair amount of lead. So I've had to purchase a USB to 12v converter. I'd also been thinking of buying an electric cooler to use inside the truck.
