This means that the truck delivers high performance off-road or on the highway. Its interior is masterfully crafted with fine materials like premium leather, and better functionality is available via a multifunctional tailgate. High-level safety is available, but you must select a trim level. Here at our dealership near Lima, Ohio, we carry the:\n\n\nHigh Country\nZR2\nLTZ\nLT Trail Boss\nRST\nLT\nCustom Trail Boss\nCustom\nWT\n\nSafety and Security\nThe 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is no slouch in the safety department. The first advantage is that the truck's frame is made from high-strength material and won't fold under pressure. Its five-star safety rating provides peace of mind while on the go, as you and your loads are fully protected. This includes at least six driver-assistance features. The idea is to prevent a road accident before it occurs, which is made possible by radar-based sensors that detect the area around you near St. Marys, Ohio.\nFront Collision Alert detects if you're approaching another vehicle too quickly from the rear. The brakes are automatically activated if the driver fails to slow down or stop. A following distance indicator prevents you from rear-ending another vehicle by keeping the Silverado 1500 safe from the vehicle in front near Wapakoneta, Ohio.\nRear Cross-Traffic Alert is another beneficial feature for Van Wert, Ohio shoppers, and it comes in handy while you're backing up. The sensors detect movement from pedestrians, vehicles, or animals. The truck's IntelliBeam headlamps automatically engage under poor lighting conditions. In addition to that, there is Lane Keep Assist, Lane Departure Warning, and Blind Spot Monitoring.\nMuch more information is available when you speak with a representative today at our dealership near Delphos.\nCategories: Green, New Inventory\nTags: 2024-Chevrolet-Silverado1500-3LT-ZR2Bison-CrewCab-Truck, Jim Schmidt Chevrolet Buick of Delphos, 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500\n\nRequest More Info\n\nSearch Blog\nSearch Blog \nSearch   \nSubscribe to Our Blog\n\nRSS 2.0\n\nPopular Tags\nnew inventory Jim Schmidt Chevrolet Buick of Delphos Used Chevy new vehicles service center Chevy Equinox Chevy Silverado 1500 Schedule Service routine maintenance New Chevy Bolt EV New Chevy Electric Vehicles Chevy SUVs 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 New Chevy Trucks New Chevy Equinox 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 tips and tricks windshield New Chevy Jim Schmidt Chevrolet Buick of Delphos's Blog Chevrolet Equinox used vehicles auto financing new cars Maintenance Center Near Me Chevy Suv Buick SUV Jumpstart your car Battery find the perfect car\nShare\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\n\nWebsite by Dealer.com AdChoices\n\nContact\nAbout\nPrivacy\nSitemap\n\n\n\n; ;"

This iconic full-size pickup has captured the attention of truck enthusiasts everywhere with its numerous features and impressive capabilities.

This is available on the High Country trim and requires an OnStar subscription.\u00c2\nInfotainment Technology\u00c2\nThe technology in the 2024 Silverado largely depends on the trim and options you choose.
