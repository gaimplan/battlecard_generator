Starting in the automotive industry straight out of college, she has evaluated and written about trucks, SUVs, and cars, from both the consumer and enthusiast perspectives, for nearly 25 years. Allyson has previously written for Motor Trend, Truck Trend, and Four Wheeler Magazine.\nPros\nExcellent towing capacity \nMany varied trim levels \nHelpful towing tech  \nCons\nNo available hybrid powertrain  \nWhat's New?\nMore standard and optional features \nNew colors \nNew wheel design  \nThe 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is a great all-around truck for work and play, with a variety of cabs, engines, and specialized trims. Pricing starts at $38,995.\nThe Chevrolet Silverado is the second best-selling vehicle in the country. This excellent all-around truck is ready for everything from family adventures to hard work. Its towing and payload capacities are just shy of the F-150\u2019s best-in-class numbers. And it offers excellent features for towing, plus a terrific off-road-oriented model. The Silverado has the capability, the comfort, and the powertrain options that will satisfy most buyers. \nThe all-electric Chevrolet Silverado EV is reviewed separately, as is the stronger Silverado HD. \nWe\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours driving and evaluating this generation of full-size pickup trucks, including the Chevrolet Silverado. \nWhat's New for 2025\nMore features become standard on different trim levels. Most notably, a trailer brake controller comes standard on LT and higher models. Cruise control is now standard on the Work Truck trim. The ZR2 gains standard premium audio and front and rear park assist. Across the trim line, there are new 20-inch high-gloss black wheels available, as well as two new paint colors. \n2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Pricing\nThe 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Regular Cab has a starting sticker price of $38,995.\nMSRP\nKBB Fair Purchase Price (national avg.)\nSilverado 1500 Regular Cab\n$38,995 - $43,795\n$37,072 - $42,152\nSilverado 1500 Double Cab\n$42,295 - $54,395\n$40,247 - $52,491\nSilverado 1500 Crew Cab\n$44,695 - $71,995\n$43,130 - $52,547\nThe Chevrolet Silverado 1500\u2019s starting price is similar to that of the Ford F-150 and slightly lower than this Chevy\u2019s corporate sibling, the GMC Sierra 1500. That Toyota Tundra, which isn\u2019t available in a regular cab model, begins several thousand dollars higher. The most popular trim level for the Silverado is the LT Crew Cab with the 5.3-liter V8 engine. \nBefore buying a new Silverado 1500 full-size truck, check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to know what you should be paying. The Tundra enjoys the strongest resale values of full-size trucks, while the Silverado 1500 is about average. \nPower, Ride, and Handling\nThe Silverado\u2019s base engine is a 310-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder engine with an incredible 430 lb-ft of torque, more torque than the 5.3-liter V8. While some might be skeptical of a 4-cylinder in a full-size truck, don\u2019t be. Response off the line is fairly quick, and there\u2019s plenty of power for most jobs. \nThe most popular engine in the Silverado is the 355-horsepower 5.3-liter V8. This is a solid choice in the Silverado, with smooth acceleration and confident power when driving on the freeway and towing. For more horsepower and torque, there\u2019s also a 420-horsepower V8. For those who want to get the setup with the maximum towing capacity, or just love the torquey, smooth acceleration of a diesel engine, that\u2019s available too. The 3.0-liter diesel engine offers 495 lb-ft of torque. \nThe Silverado drives smaller than it is, and has a comfortable ride. Braking and steering feel natural and nicely predictable. If you want a truck with an even nicer ride, the upscale, luxurious High Country trim is available with adaptive ride control. On the other end of the spectrum, the most rugged, trail-ready ZR2 has an off-road-biased suspension and wheel and tire package. It also has skid plates and comes standard with 4-wheel drive. \nPayload and Towing \nDepending on engine and cab, payload capacity ranges from 1,520 to 2,260 pounds. For the setup with the most payload capacity, look for a 2-wheel-drive Silverado with the 2.7-liter 4-cylinder engine. \nThe Silverado can tow between 8,900 and 13,300 pounds depending on configuration. If towing is your highest priority, the Silverado can tow the maximum 13,300-pound capacity with the turbodiesel engine. If you prefer gas, the 6.2-liter V8 tows up to 13,200 pounds. \nFuel Economy \nWith the highly sought-after 5.3-liter V8 and 4-wheel-drive combo, fuel economy for the Chevy Silverado is 17 mpg combined, slightly lower than the similarly equipped Ford F-150. Looking at all the engine options, fuel economy is pretty much in line with the other full-size trucks on the market. The 3.0-liter turbodiesel offers the best fuel economy you can get in the Silverado, at 26 combined mpg. That, plus its excellent towing capacity, make this engine a compelling choice. \nWhen it comes to engine choices, the Silverado (and its GMC Sierra sibling) and F-150 are available with turbo 4-cylinders or V8 engines. The F-150, Tundra, and Ram 1500 are also available with twin-turbo 6-cylinder engines. \nPractical, Clean Interior\nThe Chevrolet Silverado 1500\u2019s interior is practical and well laid out. There is room for three to six people, depending on the cab. There is plenty of headroom, and in crew cab models, rear-seat legroom is a spacious 43.4 inches. That\u2019s very good for a full-size truck. The seats are comfortable, and the interior is quiet. \nThe levels of tech and features vary based on trim level. While that\u2019s the case with many full-size trucks, it\u2019s more noticeable with the Silverado, as recent updates to the touchscreen and other tech do not come to the Work Truck and Custom trims, which get a 7-inch touchscreen \u2014 a bit small by today\u2019s standards. \nThe LT and higher trims receive a 13.4-inch touchscreen and a 12.3-inch digital gauge screen with a driver information center. These two additions add a modern touch of flair to a somewhat subdued cabin. The overall design is conservative \u2013 nothing wrong with that \u2013 until you get up to the luxurious High Country. That trim level adds two-tone leather seating, more woodgrain on the dash and doors, and lux touches that are elegant but not gaudy. \nChevy added clever storage touches inside the cab, with enough added pockets, cup holders, and cubbies to make the interior as functional as a pair of cargo pants. There are even hidden storage nooks in the centers of the rear seat cushions. The Silverado is available as a 3-passenger regular cab and as a 5-6-passenger double cab and crew cab. \nTough, Functional Exterior\nThe 2025 Silverado is designed for work duty, but the exterior also offers styling choices that are unique to the trim you choose. Grille designs and wheel options are different, for instance, and the Trail Boss adds a lifted suspension and mud terrain tires. The ZR2 takes that to the most extreme in the lineup, with the most aggressive wheel and tire package, plus skid plates. \nThe Silverado offers the choice of an 8-foot, 6.5-foot, or 5-3/4-foot bed. If you want the long bed, your only choice is the crew cab. Beds have 12 tie-down points, a corner bed step, and LED lighting in all but the Work Truck trim. You also have your choice of a regular tailgate, power up/down tailgate, or the versatile, reconfigurable Multi-Flex tailgate. \nThis year, new 20-inch high-gloss black wheels are available. Cypress Gray and Riptide Blue are new exterior colors for 2025. \nFavorite Features\nMulti-Flex tailgate \nIf the interior is like cargo pants, this tailgate is the Swiss Army knife. Depending on how you fold it, this tailgate can serve as a bed step, work surface, bed extender, and more. \nTrailering tech \nThe in-vehicle trailering app lets you test trailer lights, will sound an alert if someone tries to disconnect the trailer, and lets you set up a pre-departure checklist before towing. \nTrailer camera system \nAvailable for LTZ and higher trim levels, this camera system gives you 14 views of your truck and trailer, including one view that shows an unobstructed view of the road behind the trailer. \nCreative storage \nIn addition to storing gear under the rear seat, there are two glove boxes, plus storage spaces in the center of the rear-seat cushions. For trucks equipped with a front bench seat, there\u2019s more hidden storage under that seat. \nSuper Cruise \nSuper Cruise lets you safely drive with your hands off the wheel. It works on more than 400,000 miles of specially designated roads in North America. It also works when you\u2019re towing. It\u2019s available in the High Country trim. \nWi-Fi \nThe Silverado isn\u2019t just built for work like towing and hauling; it can also be set up for mobile office duty. Connect to the truck\u2019s Wi-Fi, and you\u2019re ready to attend meetings, check inventory, and reach out to suppliers. \nEngine & Transmission\nThe engine in the most affordable trim levels is a 2.7-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder. Its 310 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque is more than sufficient for most people. It uses an 8-speed automatic transmission and is available with 2- or 4-wheel drive. \nThe most popular engine, the 5.3-liter V8, makes 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque. Also available with 2- or 4-wheel drive, this engine is standard in the LTZ and High Country, and optional in the Work Truck, LT, RST, and Trail Boss trims. It\u2019s backed by a 10-speed automatic transmission. \nFor extra oomph and more exhilarating acceleration, there\u2019s the 6.2-liter V8, which also uses the 10-speed automatic. This engine has 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. It comes standard with 4-wheel drive and is available with the RST, LT Trail Boss, LTZ, High Country, and ZR2. \nThe fourth engine in the lineup is a 3.0-liter 6-cylinder, 305-horsepower turbodiesel. It has 495 lb-ft of torque, as well as the best fuel economy of the line. The turbodiesel comes standard on the ZR2 and is available on the Custom Trail Boss, LT, LT Trail Boss, RST, LTZ, and High Country. \n3-Year/36,000-Mile Warranty \nChevrolet\u2019s new-vehicle warranty lasts three years or 36,000 miles, whichever happens first. Powertrains are covered for five years or 60,000 miles. These are typical for the class. Roadside assistance is also provided for the same term as the powertrain. And the first scheduled maintenance service is free. \nSafety ratings \nThe Chevy Silverado 1500 Crew Cab did fairly well in crash-testing performed by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) with scores of Good in the main categories, except for a Marginal in the front passenger-side small overlap impact.

It's available in a variety of trim levels including the base Work Truck, the well-equipped LT, the rugged Trail Boss and the loaded High Country. And there's also the off-road ZR2 version. There's plenty to pick from in the powertrain department too. Its standard turbocharged four-cylinder engine is no slouch \u2014 it produces more torque than the 5.3-liter V8 and almost as much as the 6.2-liter V8. Chevy also offers a turbodiesel engine for the Silverado, which is significant because both the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500 no longer do. The diesel engine is pricey but provides the best combo of power and fuel economy.\nCost to DriveCost to drive estimates for the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Work Truck 2dr Regular Cab SB (2.7L 4cyl Turbo 8A) and comparison vehicles are based on 15,000 miles per year (with a mix of 55% city and 45% highway driving) and energy estimates of $4.85 per gallon for regular unleaded in California.\nMonthly estimates based on costs in California\n$306/mo \u00a0for Silverado 1500 Work Truck\nSilverado 1500 Work Truck\nvs\n$325/mo\nAvg.

But the light-duty truck segment is extremely competitive. The F-150 offers some helpful features, such as a robust onboard generator, that you can't get on the Silverado, while the Ram 1500 and Toyota Tundra have their own distinctive appeal. Check out our test team's in-depth Expert Rating below for a complete report on the Silverado's utility, tech, performance and more.\nEdmunds Expert Rating\nOur VerdictThe Edmunds Vehicle Testing Team evaluates a fresh batch of vehicles every week, pairing objective assessments at our test track with real-world driving on city streets, freeways and winding roads. The data we gather results in our Expert Ratings. They\u2019re based on 30-plus scores that cover every aspect of the automotive experience.\nAverage\n7.5\nout of 10\nedmunds TESTED\nThe 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 stays true to its old-school roots, and the latest updates to the interior and technology do a lot to help this truck be more competitive against its full-size rivals. But lackluster comfort and value keep it from being a top pick.\nRated for you by America's best test team.\nPerformance\n7.5/10\nHow does the Silverado 1500 drive? We tested a Silverado crew cab in the High Country trim with the 5.3-liter V8 and four-wheel drive. Acceleration and braking are sufficient for daily driving or towing. Our test truck covered 60 mph in about 7 seconds from a standstill at our test track. An equivalent F-150 is a little quicker, but there's nothing wrong with the Silverado's power. Around town, the transmission shifts smoothly and makes the most of the engine's low-end torque.  \nThe truck tracks straight on the highway, but the steering effort is a bit too light. Handling is secure, and body roll is effectively held in check as you navigate turns. But midcorner bumps can upset the Silverado pretty easily. Going off-road? A regular 4WD Silverado will suffice, but consider getting the Z71 off-road option package or the Trail Boss trim level to enhance its potential.\nRead more\nComfort\n7/10\nHow comfortable is the Silverado 1500? The Silverado's seating isn't quite as plush as the seats in the F-150 or Ram 1500, yet there's enough padding and support to keep you comfortable on long drives. The ride is relatively smooth on the highway, and the truck ably absorbs most small impacts. But it can get bouncy when you drive on roads that have a high frequency of bumps and dips.  \nThe climate system easily heats and cools the cabin, though operating it can be a little tricky because a lot of the control buttons are small. We really like the optional ventilated and split-heated front seats (separate settings for the seatback and seat cushion), a GM-exclusive feature. Engine noise is effectively muted until you get aggressive with the throttle, at which point it gets a bit unpleasant.\nRead more\nInterior\n7.5/10\nHow\u2019s the interior? Chevrolet finally provided the sorely needed interior upgrade Silverado owners have wanted for years. The latest cabin design looks and feels far more modern than the one used for the 2019-2021 trucks, with sporty elements on the ZR2 trim and upscale materials on top-tier trims like the High Country. Importantly, most of the controls are easy to use, a staple of the previous model, with large clear buttons and a swift touchscreen.  \nInside, the Silverado has plenty of space for adults in its crew-cab configuration. This is particularly evident in the back seat, which has massive legroom to offer. Some models sit high off the ground, but large door openings and proper seat positioning make overall accessibility a positive experience.\nRead more\nContinue reading Edmunds Expert Rating below\nSave as much as $11,026\u00a0with Edmunds Click on the trim you\u2019re interested in to see what Edmunds suggests you should pay to get a good deal.

Technology is a strong point in the Silverado. An available 13.4-inch touchscreen offers a wide range of capability without confusing the user, and the hi-res screen responds quickly to clicks and swipes. There are also clear maps, and navigation finds addresses and points of interest quickly. Plus, the Google-powered voice recognition system understands natural language and reads your command back to you on the screen. With your voice, you can change the station, adjust the climate control and more.  \nOur test truck came with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, both with wireless connectivity. CarPlay looked great on the massive screen. There's a dedicated storage space for your smartphone, and some models include a wireless charger. Driver aids are abundant, with several available exterior cameras that help when parking this behemoth of a truck. The rear cross-traffic warning system and its helpful buzzes in the seat bottom are effective too.  \nAdaptive cruise control generally works well, particularly for such a large vehicle. However, we did experience one instance with our test truck where it unexpectedly lurched forward with the system on in stop-and-go traffic; our driver had to quickly apply the brakes to override it. This put a stain on an otherwise positive experience. GM's hands-free driver assist technology, Super Cruise, is available but only on the top-trim High Country \u2014 Ford offers its similar BlueCruise system on several F-150 trims.\nRead more\nTowing and Storage\n8/10\nHow are the towing and storage? We tested a 5.3-liter V8-powered, short-bed 4WD crew-cab truck that had the standard 3.23 axle gearing. This configuration provided plenty of towing and hauling capability for our needs. As for the bed itself, it's a bit longer, deeper and wider than its rivals, and it has more tie-downs.  \nThe Silverado's boxy center console contains multiple pockets, but we've found the F-150's and Ram 1500's center consoles to be a little more versatile for storing items. For family duty, the crew cab's back seat has two sets of lower car seat anchors and three top tethers, so child safety seats will fit in any of the three positions. But loading the seats, not to mention the kiddos, might be difficult due to the truck's ride height.\nRead more\nContinue reading Edmunds Expert Rating below\nConsider these recommendations\nFuel Economy\n7.5/10\nHow\u2019s the fuel economy? The Silverado High Country we tested had the 5.3-liter V8 and 4WD, which earns an EPA-estimated 18 mpg in combined city/highway driving. We found that number to be reasonably achievable in the real world. The best fuel economy for the Silverado comes from the available diesel-fueled six-cylinder.\nValue\n6.5/10\nIs the Silverado 1500 a good value? The Silverado isn't outrageously expensive, but it is priced higher than its key rivals without offering any advantages in features, style or interior quality. The buttons and dashboard plastics are similar to those in the previous-gen truck: sturdy but somewhat cheap-looking. Chevy's warranty coverage is average, though you do get the first scheduled maintenance for free.\nRead more\nWildcard\n7/10\nFull-size trucks such as the Silverado aren't necessarily fun to drive. But with its commanding view of the road, lots of towing power, and brutish front-end styling, the Silverado can put a smile on your face. However, the interior looks dated and borrows many pieces and design cues from the previous generation. It may or may not be the full-size truck personality you want.\nRead more\nWhich Silverado 1500 does Edmunds recommend?\nThe sheer variety of configurations and options makes it difficult to recommend a singular Silverado for every buyer. But broadly, the LT trim is a good place to start your research. It comes with a pleasing mix of features for the price, and it's the first trim in the Silverado lineup that offers three engine choices including the diesel.\nCompare 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 trim levels\nHelpful trims summary and side-by-side comparison chart\nChevrolet Silverado 1500 models\nThe 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is a full-size pickup available in nine trim levels: Work Truck (WT), Custom, Custom Trail Boss, LT, RST, LT Trail Boss, ZR2, LTZ and High Country. Like most full-size trucks, the Silverado is offered in varying cab and bed configurations, including a two-door regular cab, a four-door extended cab (Double Cab), and a four-door crew cab with full-size rear doors and generous rear seat room. Depending on cab selection, the three available bed sizes are an 8-foot-long bed, a 6.5-foot bed and a shorter 5-foot-8-inch bed. Keep reading for our editorial team's rundown of the Silverado's engines and features.\nChevrolet offers four available engines for the Silverado 1500:\n\nTurbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine (310 hp, 430 lb-ft) with an eight-speed automatic transmission\n5.3-liter V8 engine (355 hp, 383 lb-ft) with a 10-speed automatic transmission\n6.2-liter V8 engine (420 hp, 460 lb-ft) with a 10-speed automatic transmission\nTurbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder diesel engine (305 hp, 495 lb-ft) with a 10-speed automatic transmission\n\nWe've noted which engines come standard or optional on each trim. Rear-wheel drive is typically standard, with four-wheel drive an option. Other Silverado feature highlights include:\nWT\nThe basic Silverado Work Truck comes standard with the four-cylinder engine but the 5.3-liter V8 is available at an additional cost. Other standard features include:\n\nVinyl seat upholstery\nRubber floor covering\nAir conditioning\nPower windows and door locks\n7-inch touchscreen\nWireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n\nThe Work Truck also includes these advanced driver aids:\n\nForward collision warning with automatic braking (warns you of an impending collision and applies the brakes in certain scenarios)\nLane departure warning (alerts you if the vehicle begins to drift out of its lane)\nLane keeping assistance (steers the Silverado back into its lane if it begins to drift over the lane marker)\n\nCustom\nThe Custom trim improves the Silverado's appearance and allows for the extended- or crew-cab configuration. It is only available with the four-cylinder engine and includes:\n\nRemote engine start\nCruise control\nCloth upholstery\nLED cargo bed lighting\nPower-adjustable, heated exterior mirrors\nPower-adjustable driver's seat\nTrailering package\n120-volt power outlets\nHitch guidance lines for backup camera\n\nCustom Trail Boss\nThe Trail Boss has the four-cylinder engine standard; the 5.3-liter V8 or the six-cylinder diesel is optional. It equips the Custom with the look and capability of an off-road truck by adding:\n\nFour-wheel drive\nTwo-speed transfer case\nUnderbody skid plates\nZ71 off-road suspension package\n18-inch wheels with all-terrain tires\nAutomatic locking rear differential\nHill descent control\n\nLT\nThe Silverado LT offers the same engines as the Custom Trail Boss.

Otherwise, it essentially adds a sport-truck appearance to the Silverado LT.\nLT Trail Boss\nThis version of the Trail Boss can be had with any of the four engine choices and builds on the Custom Trail Boss trim by adding:\n\nLED headlights\nPower-adjustable driver's seat\nHeated front seats\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nHeated leather-wrapped steering wheel\n\nZR2\nThe off-road-focused ZR2 trim is only available with the 6.2-liter V8 or the diesel six-cylinder.

It adds styling elements and more off-road capability with:\n\n18-inch black wheels with 33-inch mud-terrain tires\nStronger skid plates for the front underbody, transfer case, rear differential and fuel tank\nUpgraded front and rear bumpers that improve approach and departure angles\nSteel rocker panel protection\nUnique grille\nBison and American Expedition Vehicles (AEV) interior and exterior badging and decals\n\nLTZ\nOne of two premium versions of the Silverado, the LTZ is only available as a crew cab and is offered with all engines except for the four-cylinder.

Numerous trailer monitoring systems that allow for trailer tire-pressure sensors or trailer rearview-camera connections are also available.\nEdmunds Latest Chevrolet Silverado 1500 News\n Edmunds Tested: Electric Car Range and Consumption Chevy Corvette Z06 vs. Maserati MC20: Edmunds U-Drags Mid-Engine Battle Chevy Traverse Cargo Test: How Much Can You Fit Behind the Third Row? 2025 Chevy Corvette ZR1 Pricing: $175K Base, $206K Loaded\nRead more\nChevrolet Silverado 1500 Reviews\nOwner Reviews\n4.4 out of 5 stars 33 reviews\n5(76%)\n4(6%)\n3(6%)\n2(9%)\n1(3%)\nWrite a vehicle reviewSee all 33 reviews\nMost Helpful Owner Reviews\nTrending topics\n\nride quality\nengine\nfuel efficiency\nappearance\ninterior\ndriving experience\nvalue\nspaciousness\ntowing\nhandling & steering\nacceleration\noff-roading\nsteering wheel\nsound system\nbrakes\ndoors\nreliability & manufacturing quality\nclimate control\nsafety\ncup holders\ninfotainment system\ntechnology\nseats\nwarranty\ndashboard\n\nMore\n2024 Silverado Cam Sensor Position 594 miles!\n1 out of 5 stars\nGeorge Owings Mills, MD, 08/27/2024\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Custom 4dr Crew Cab 4WD 6.6 ft. SB (2.7L 4cyl Turbo 8A)\nJust bought a Silverado Custom with 2.7 Turbomax 4 cycl. With 594 miles on it, it starts shaking and shimmying at a light. Hit the gas and the engine is shaking like crazy. Take it back to dealer and 2 cylinders needed to be replaced! Heritage Chevrolet in Owings Mills, MD would not switch out the truck for a new one. I am beyond vexed because that truck will never be the same. I\u00a0\u2026 can care less about a warranty. How about do right by your customers and take back a defective product and fight it out with GM for sending you a bad truck! The customer always gets the short end of the stick.\nRead more\nRead less\nNew diesel owner\n5 out of 5 stars\nScott Langlais, 04/22/2024\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 ZR2 4dr Crew Cab 4WD 5.8 ft. SB (3.0L 6cyl Turbodiesel 10A)\nThis is my first diesel truck. I went with the 3.0 Duramax. I was concerned it would not have enough power as I pull a lot of construction trailers. I am so pleased with this truck. I might not accelerate as fast as the 6.2 gas motor, but nobody needs to accelerate like that in the first place. Especially 1 pollen trailers. This is a very smooth truck and I am averaging above 18 mpg with\u00a0\u2026 consistent runs with my dump trailer.\nRead more\nRead less\nOver All good\n5 out of 5 stars\nRuss427, 03/06/2024\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LTZ 4dr Crew Cab 4WD 6.6 ft. SB (5.3L 8cyl 10A)\nIt's almost everything I wanted. But no moon roof or sliding back glass. Major flaw is the auto shut off when stopping. Have to shut that off every time I get in the truck. Also don't like the timer shut off when outside the truck. Not safe for people who are waiting inside the truck in hot/cold weather. No way to override it.\nTruck for work or pleasure\n5 out of 5 stars\nValor Trooper , 09/24/2024\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LTZ 4dr Crew Cab 5.8 ft. SB (5.3L 8cyl 10A)\nI traded a 2020 Chevy Silverado LTZ crew cab, leather seats, black exterior color, short bed, 4x4 with Z71 options, 8 speed transmission, and 5.3 v8 for a 2024 Chevy Silverado LTZ crew cab, leather seats, metallic silver color, short bed, 4x4 minus the Z71 options, 10 speed transmission, and 5.3 v8. The 2024 Chevy Silverado has options( automatic steps, multi purpose tailgate, heads up\u00a0\u2026 display, 22 inch tires w/chrome wheels, power sun roof, power rear center window, and sprayed bed liner) some of which were not part of the 2020 Chevy Silverado. The 2024 Chevy minus the Z71 option with 22 inch wheels and road style tires rides a bit smoother than my 2020 Chevy. I still maintain the 4x4 capability when needed especially with the Illinois winters and some mild off road traveling. The shift/gear selector is now located on the center console rather than the steering column which provides no inconvenience for either use or position placement. At my senior age of 81 and before I have always enjoyed my trucks and have had quite a few including Chevy, GMC, Ford, & Toyota trucks. The 2024 Silverado LTZ continues to be a pricey purchase as truck prices across the brand spectrum are all pricey purchases. I am pleased with my 2024 Silverado with regard to performance and design. This is my first metallic silver exterior color which looks great and reflects the sun heat better than my previous black exterior colored trucks. If price is not a limiting factor, I believe you would enjoy owning and driving a full size 1500, Silverado LTZ.\nRead more\nRead less\nSee all 33 reviews of the Chevrolet Silverado 1500\nWrite a vehicle review\nHelpful shopping links\n\n\nSee All for Sale\n\n\nBuild & Price\n\n\nDeals & Incentives\n\n\nLease Offers\n\n\nPrice Checker\u2122\n\n\nShop Used\n\n\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 videos\nFord F-150 Lightning TOW TEST! | Real-World Truck Towing Comparison | EV vs. Diesel, Gas & Hybrid\nFord F-150 Lightning TOW TEST! | Real-World Truck Towing Comparison | EV vs. Diesel, Gas & Hybrid\nNOTE: This video is about the 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 1500, but since the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is part of the same generation, our earlier analysis still applies.\n\n Ford F-150 Lightning TOW TEST! | Real-World Truck Towing Com...\n The Updated 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 | It's Refreshed B...\n Best Trucks Under $60K | Which Pickups Offer the Best Bang f...\n 2022 Chevy Silverado ZR2 First Drive | Off-Roading in the Ne...\n\n\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Features & Specs\nType:\nCrew Cab\nTrim:\nWork Truck\n\nBase MSRPExcludes Destination Fee$42,500Engine TypeGasCombined MPG20 MPGCost to Drive$306/monthSeating6 seatsDrivetrainRear Wheel DriveFour Wheel Driverear wheel driveMax Towing Capacity9,500 lbs.Warranty3 years / 36,000 miles\n\nSee all features & specs\n\nCompare the Chevrolet Silverado 1500\n\n\n\nChevrolet\u00a0Silverado 1500\n\nCompare\n\n\n\nFord F-150\n\nCompare\n\n\n\nRam 1500\n\nCompare\n\n\nAdd any vehicle to compare\n\n\nCompare selected vehicles\nChevrolet Silverado 1500 vs. Ford F-150\nThe F-150 outperforms the Silverado in most ways including performance, comfort and value. It offers more engine options, including a hybrid engine that's more powerful than any of the Silverado's engines. The Ford also has a higher towing capacity and can carry more weight in its bed. And when it comes to off-roading, Chevy doesn't have anything like the highly capable Raptor and 700-horsepower Raptor R. To top it off, Ford offers the innovative Pro Power Onboard system. Read Edmunds' long-term road test review of the F-150 Hybrid.\nCompare Chevrolet Silverado 1500 & Ford F-150 features\u00a0\nChevrolet Silverado 1500 vs. Ram 1500\nThe Ram 1500 is an excellent alternative to the Silverado especially if you prefer superior ride comfort and a luxurious interior. Topping the Ram's lineup is the insane 702-horsepower TRX, which is quicker and more capable than the ZR2. Ram also offers the convenient RamBox in-bed locking bins. The Ram 1500, however, doesn't have a hands-free driving system like Super Cruise. Read Edmunds' long-term road test review of the Ram 1500.\nCompare Chevrolet Silverado 1500 & Ram 1500 features\u00a0\nChevrolet Silverado 1500 vs. Toyota Tundra\nThe Tundra is a well-rounded pickup powered by a turbocharged V6 or a powerful hybrid version of that engine. It offers an attractive interior with an optional, impressive-looking 14-inch touchscreen display. The TRD Pro model delivers solid capability, but you'll likely be more impressed with the ZR2, especially the Bison Edition. The Tundra offers not only fewer engine choices but also fewer cab and bed configurations than the Chevy, and it has a lower max towing capacity.\nCompare Chevrolet Silverado 1500 & Toyota Tundra features\u00a0\n\nPRICE CHECKER\u2122\nCheck a dealer's price\nBring back a dealer's quote, and we'll tell you if it's a good price!\nBased on nearby sales up through February 10th\nYou should take it!\nGood Price:\n8388,888380\nGraph shown is a sample only\nGet started\n\nAdvertisement  Build Your 2024 Silverado 1500  At a Glance: * 1 Trim * $36,800starting MSRP  Build & Price Chevrolet.comDisclaimer\n*The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price excludes destination freight charge, tax, title, license, dealer fees and optional equipment.

There's also an all-electric Silverado EV, which is reviewed separately. The Silverado 1500 is offered in a variety of trim levels and engine choices to appeal to any truck buyer and budget, from a basic work vehicle to off-road-capable models and a luxurious top-of-the-line trim. This class of trucks is extremely competitive, so be sure to check out our Expert Rating to confirm how the Silverado 1500 stacks up against the competition.\nCost to DriveCost to drive estimates for the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Work Truck 2dr Regular Cab SB (2.7L 4cyl Turbo 8A) and comparison vehicles are based on 15,000 miles per year (with a mix of 55% city and 45% highway driving) and energy estimates of $4.85 per gallon for regular unleaded in California.\nMonthly estimates based on costs in California\n$313/mo \u00a0for Silverado 1500 Work Truck\nSilverado 1500 Work Truck\nvs\n$325/mo\nAvg. Large Truck\nCalculate my fuel costs\nEdmunds spotlight: Smart use of technology\nThe Silverado 1500 gets a shoutout for its use of technology. The infotainment system is available with a large 13.4-inch touchscreen and benefits from easy-to-read graphics and quick responses to user inputs. On LT and higher trim levels, drivers can leverage the truck's Google-based voice recognition system to make infotainment interactions easier and less distracting. Features such as trailer tire pressure sensors and auxiliary rearview cameras make towing safer and reduce stress, while GM's Super Cruise allows for hands-free highway driving. The Ford F-150 is the only other truck with this level of driving automation.\nCompetitors to consider\nThere's a four-way tug-of-war at the top of the full-size pickup class. The Ford F-150 leads in sales and in Edmunds' rankings thanks to its hefty 13,500-pound tow capacity and clever features that include an onboard generator. The Silverado 1500 comes close with its tow rating of up to 13,300 pounds, and they both beat the 2025 Ram 1500, with its max of 11,550 pounds. Even so, we rate the Ram higher for its smoother ride quality and refined interior. The Toyota Tundra has a similar suspension design with corresponding ride-quality advantages, and it's also available with a hybrid powertrain.\nEdmunds Expert Rating\nOur VerdictThe Edmunds Vehicle Testing Team evaluates a fresh batch of vehicles every week, pairing objective assessments at our test track with real-world driving on city streets, freeways and winding roads. The data we gather results in our Expert Ratings. They\u2019re based on 30-plus scores that cover every aspect of the automotive experience.\nAverage\n7.5\nout of 10\nedmunds TESTED\nThe 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 stays true to its old-school roots, and the latest updates to the interior and technology do a lot to help this truck be more competitive against its full-size rivals. But lackluster comfort and value keep it from being a top pick.\nRated for you by America's best test team.\nPerformance\n7.5/10\nHow does the Silverado 1500 drive? We tested a Silverado crew cab in the High Country trim with the 5.3-liter V8 and four-wheel drive. Acceleration and braking are sufficient for daily driving or towing. Our test truck covered 60 mph in about 7 seconds from a standstill at our test track. An equivalent F-150 is a little quicker, but there's nothing wrong with the Silverado's power. Around town, the transmission shifts smoothly and makes the most of the engine's low-end torque.  \nThe truck tracks straight on the highway, but the steering effort is a bit too light. Handling is secure, and body roll is effectively held in check as you navigate turns. But midcorner bumps can upset the Silverado pretty easily. Going off-road? A regular 4WD Silverado will suffice, but consider getting the Z71 off-road option package or the Trail Boss trim level to enhance its potential.\nRead more\nComfort\n7/10\nHow comfortable is the Silverado 1500? The Silverado's seating isn't quite as plush as the seats in the F-150 or Ram 1500, yet there's enough padding and support to keep you comfortable on long drives. The ride is relatively smooth on the highway, and the truck ably absorbs most small impacts. But it can get bouncy when you drive on roads that have a high frequency of bumps and dips.  \nThe climate system easily heats and cools the cabin, though operating it can be a little tricky because a lot of the control buttons are small. We really like the optional ventilated and split-heated front seats (separate settings for the seatback and seat cushion), a GM-exclusive feature. Engine noise is effectively muted until you get aggressive with the throttle, at which point it gets a bit unpleasant.\nRead more\nInterior\n7.5/10\nHow\u2019s the interior? Chevrolet finally provided the sorely needed interior upgrade Silverado owners have wanted for years. The latest cabin design looks and feels far more modern than the one used for the 2019-2021 trucks, with sporty elements on the ZR2 trim and upscale materials on top-tier trims like the High Country. Importantly, most of the controls are easy to use, a staple of the previous model, with large clear buttons and a swift touchscreen.  \nInside, the Silverado has plenty of space for adults in its crew-cab configuration. This is particularly evident in the back seat, which has massive legroom to offer. Some models sit high off the ground, but large door openings and proper seat positioning make overall accessibility a positive experience.\nRead more\nContinue reading Edmunds Expert Rating below\nSave as much as $7,059\u00a0with Edmunds Click on the trim you\u2019re interested in to see what Edmunds suggests you should pay to get a good deal.

Technology is a strong point in the Silverado. An available 13.4-inch touchscreen offers a wide range of capability without confusing the user, and the hi-res screen responds quickly to clicks and swipes. There are also clear maps, and navigation finds addresses and points of interest quickly. Plus, the Google-powered voice recognition system understands natural language and reads your command back to you on the screen. With your voice, you can change the station, adjust the climate control and more.  \nOur test truck came with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, both with wireless connectivity. CarPlay looked great on the massive screen. There's a dedicated storage space for your smartphone, and some models include a wireless charger. Driver aids are abundant, with several available exterior cameras that help when parking this behemoth of a truck. The rear cross-traffic warning system and its helpful buzzes in the seat bottom are effective too.  \nAdaptive cruise control generally works well, particularly for such a large vehicle. However, we did experience one instance with our test truck where it unexpectedly lurched forward with the system on in stop-and-go traffic; our driver had to quickly apply the brakes to override it. This put a stain on an otherwise positive experience. GM's hands-free driver assist technology, Super Cruise, is available but only on the top-trim High Country \u2014 Ford offers its similar BlueCruise system on several F-150 trims.\nRead more\nTowing and Storage\n8/10\nHow are the towing and storage? We tested a 5.3-liter V8-powered, short-bed 4WD crew-cab truck that had the standard 3.23 axle gearing. This configuration provided plenty of towing and hauling capability for our needs. As for the bed itself, it's a bit longer, deeper and wider than its rivals, and it has more tie-downs.  \nThe Silverado's boxy center console contains multiple pockets, but we've found the F-150's and Ram 1500's center consoles to be a little more versatile for storing items. For family duty, the crew cab's back seat has two sets of lower car seat anchors and three top tethers, so child safety seats will fit in any of the three positions. But loading the seats, not to mention the kiddos, might be difficult due to the truck's ride height.\nRead more\nContinue reading Edmunds Expert Rating below\nFuel Economy\n7.5/10\nHow\u2019s the fuel economy? The Silverado High Country we tested had the 5.3-liter V8 and 4WD, which earns an EPA-estimated 17 mpg in combined city/highway driving. We found that number to be reasonably achievable in the real world. The best fuel economy for the Silverado comes from the available diesel-fueled six-cylinder.\nValue\n6.5/10\nIs the Silverado 1500 a good value? The Silverado isn't outrageously expensive, but it is priced higher than its key rivals without offering any advantages in features, style or interior quality. The buttons and dashboard plastics are similar to those in the previous-gen truck: sturdy but somewhat cheap-looking. Chevy's warranty coverage is average, though you do get the first scheduled maintenance for free.\nRead more\nWildcard\n7/10\nFull-size trucks such as the Silverado aren't necessarily fun to drive. But with its commanding view of the road, lots of towing power, and brutish front-end styling, the Silverado can put a smile on your face. However, the interior looks dated and borrows many pieces and design cues from the previous generation. It may or may not be the full-size truck personality you want.\nRead more\nWhich Silverado 1500 does Edmunds recommend?\nWith nine distinct models and four engines to choose from, the Silverado 1500 gives shoppers plenty of options to suit their particular needs. For many, the midrange LT will be a good fit, offering a much nicer interior than the basic Work Truck while forgoing all-terrain features and luxury items that may not be needed.\nCompare 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 trim levels\nHelpful trims summary and side-by-side comparison chart\nChevrolet Silverado 1500 models\nThe 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is a full-size pickup available in nine trim levels: Work Truck (WT), Custom, Custom Trail Boss, LT, RST, LT Trail Boss, ZR2, LTZ and High Country. Like most full-size trucks, the Silverado is offered in varying cab and bed configurations, including a two-door regular cab, a four-door extended cab (Double Cab), and a four-door crew cab with full-size rear doors and generous rear seat room. Depending on cab selection, the three available bed sizes are an 8-foot-long bed, a 6.5-foot bed and a shorter 5-foot-8-inch bed.

No way to override it.\nTruck for work or pleasure\n5 out of 5 stars\nValor Trooper , 09/24/2024\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LTZ 4dr Crew Cab 5.8 ft. SB (5.3L 8cyl 10A)\nI traded a 2020 Chevy Silverado LTZ crew cab, leather seats, black exterior color, short bed, 4x4 with Z71 options, 8 speed transmission, and 5.3 v8 for a 2024 Chevy Silverado LTZ crew cab, leather seats, metallic silver color, short bed, 4x4 minus the Z71 options, 10 speed transmission, and 5.3 v8. The 2024 Chevy Silverado has options( automatic steps, multi purpose tailgate, heads up\u00a0\u2026 display, 22 inch tires w/chrome wheels, power sun roof, power rear center window, and sprayed bed liner) some of which were not part of the 2020 Chevy Silverado. The 2024 Chevy minus the Z71 option with 22 inch wheels and road style tires rides a bit smoother than my 2020 Chevy. I still maintain the 4x4 capability when needed especially with the Illinois winters and some mild off road traveling. The shift/gear selector is now located on the center console rather than the steering column which provides no inconvenience for either use or position placement. At my senior age of 81 and before I have always enjoyed my trucks and have had quite a few including Chevy, GMC, Ford, & Toyota trucks. The 2024 Silverado LTZ continues to be a pricey purchase as truck prices across the brand spectrum are all pricey purchases. I am pleased with my 2024 Silverado with regard to performance and design. This is my first metallic silver exterior color which looks great and reflects the sun heat better than my previous black exterior colored trucks. If price is not a limiting factor, I believe you would enjoy owning and driving a full size 1500, Silverado LTZ.\nRead more\nRead less\nWe have a limited number of reviews for the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500, so we've included reviews for other years of the Silverado 1500 since its last redesign.\nSee all 38 reviews of the Chevrolet Silverado 1500\nWrite a vehicle review\nHelpful shopping links\n\n\nSee All for Sale\n\n\nBuild & Price\n\n\nDeals & Incentives\n\n\nLease Offers\n\n\nPrice Checker\u2122\n\n\nShop Used\n\n\n2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 video\nFord F-150 Tremor vs. Ram 1500 Rebel vs. Chevy Silverado Trail Boss | Off-Road Comparison Test\nFord F-150 Tremor vs. Ram 1500 Rebel vs. Chevy Silverado Trail Boss | Off-Road Comparison Test\nWe\u2019re putting America\u2019s best-selling trucks \u2014 the Ford F-150, Chevy Silverado and Ram 1500 \u2013 up against one another on the trails.

It's one of the most successful vehicles on sale in terms of sheer units moved, and it's always given the Ford F-150 a run for its money. The Silverado received a major face-lift for 2022 that brought its interior right up to date with rivals from Ford and Ram. There's plenty to pick from in the powertrain department too. Its standard turbocharged four-cylinder engine is no slouch \u2014 it produces more torque than the 5.3-liter V8 and almost as much as the 6.2-liter V8. Chevy also offers a turbodiesel engine for the Silverado, which is significant because both the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500 no longer do. Because of those recent updates, we doubt we'll see any significant changes for 2025.\nEdmunds spotlight: Class-leading interior tech\nWith its 2022 face-lift, Chevy brought the Silverado's interior tech bang up to date. It did better than that \u2014 it built a class leader. Chevy based its new infotainment on Google's software, and the results are a more responsive system, the best voice recognition in the business, and features like Alexa and the Google Play Store to help you control your home from your car and tailor the infotainment experience to exactly what your needs are with Google apps. But don't worry \u2014 it still has Apple CarPlay and Android Auto despite GM's move away from the phone mirroring software in its newer models.\nCompetitors to consider\nThe Silverado's archrival, the Ford F-150, is always an option when you're looking at a Silverado. The Ford offers more tech and a hybrid model that can power off-board accessories and work tools. The Ford also recently got a big face-lift that brings with it more power for base models and updated Raptor models. If you want something that can go off-road fast, the Raptor is the way to go (and a car Chevy has no answer for).\nEdmunds says\nThe Silverado is a solid buy even if the F-150 lineup is more well rounded.\n\nFAQ\nIs the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 a good car?\nThe Edmunds experts tested the 2025 Silverado 1500 both on the road and at the track, giving it a 7.5 out of 10.
