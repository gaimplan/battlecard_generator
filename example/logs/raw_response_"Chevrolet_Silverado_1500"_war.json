    "answer": "The Chevrolet Silverado 1500 comes with a comprehensive warranty package. The base warranty coverage includes a 3-year/36,000-mile limited warranty that covers repairs for most defects in materials or workmanship, with no deductible. Additionally, Chevrolet offers a powertrain warranty, which typically extends to 5 years or 100,000 miles, whichever comes first. For certain eAssist components on Silverado eAssist models, General Motors provides an extended warranty of 8 years or 100,000 miles (160,000 kilometers). This coverage applies to both vehicles sold in the United States and Canada. Chevrolet also offers additional protection plans that can cover up to 1,500 parts on the vehicle, depending on the selected plan level (Powertrain, Silver, or Platinum).

Knowing these exclusions ensures you\u2019re prepared and can plan for proper care and maintenance of your truck.\n1.)

Be cautious: modifications or the use of non-GM-approved parts can void your warranty in certain areas. For example:\n1.) Installing a non-Chevrolet aftermarket turbocharger\n2.)

Cosmetic damage like paint scratches or upholstery wear\n2.) Normal aging of the vehicle (e.g., fading or cracking of materials)\n3.) Repairs for components not explicitly covered, such as infotainment systems or non-drivetrain electrical issues (these may fall under a different warranty).\nHow to Stay Protected\nUnderstanding these exclusions helps you take proactive steps, like keeping up with routine maintenance and choosing GM-certified technicians for any repairs.

Here\u2019s how you can get the most out of your warranty and keep your Silverado running at its best for years to come.\n1. Follow the Recommended Maintenance Schedule\nThe first step in ensuring your\u00a0Silverado 1500\u00a0stays covered under its powertrain warranty is adhering to Chevrolet\u2019s recommended maintenance schedule.

Not only will you get comprehensive coverage for a number of issues, but you\u2019ll also get roadside assistance and much more. Visit us at Phelps Chevroletfor more information.\nChevrolet Limited Warranties\nNo matter which of our excellent vehicles you purchase, you\u2019ll receive complimentary bumper-to-bumper coverage for up to three years or 36,000 miles, whichever comes first. This warranty plan covers everything from workmanship defects, but it\u2019s important to note that it doesn\u2019t include every single Chevy partinside your car. Corrosion protection and emissions warranties are also included in this warranty program.\nYou\u2019ll also receive a limited powertrain warranty lasting up to five years or 60,000 miles. This portion of the warranty covers every part that makes up your powertrain, including the engine, drivetrain, and transmission. This warranty is extended to 100,000 miles if you choose a fleet vehicle.\nCertified Pre-Owned Warranty\nHowever, you don\u2019t have to buy new to get excellent coverage. When you choose one of our Certified Pre-Owned Chevy models, you\u2019ll receive two factory-backed warranties designed to give you extra confidence behind the wheel.\nThe first is a 6-year/100,000-mile powertrain limited warranty, and the second is a 12-month/12,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty. You\u2019ll also receive additional benefits like 24/7 roadside assistance and a 3-day/150-mile exchange program.\nOther Warranties\nChevrolet offers numerous protection plans if you\u2019re looking for additional coverage. The Chevrolet Protection Plan adds coverage for up to 1,500 parts on your vehicle depending on if you select the Powertrain, Silver, or Platinum plan.\nYou can also opt for the EV Protection Plan, which adds specific coverage for parts you\u2019ll only find inside a fully electric vehicle. Tire & Wheel Protection is also available, adding coverage when replacing worn-out or damaged tires.\nVisit Phelps Chevrolet For Additional Information\nIf you have any other questions concerning warranty coverage available for Chevy vehicles, stop by our Greenville, NC, Chevrolet dealershiptoday.

The Chevy warranty package is known throughout the industry for its exceptional coverage, and our customers agree. Between a 5-year Powertrain Warranty and 24/7 Roadside Assistance, you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find a better deal. Read on to find out what the Chevy warranty covers, and feel free to check out our new inventory at Bowman Chevy!\nSheet Metal\nWhile all Chevy vehicles were built to withstand years of wear and tear, you can keep your car in mint condition with the help of corrosion and rust-through coverage! Corrosion coverage lasts for 3 years or 36,000 miles, while rust-through coverage lasts for 6 years or 100,000 miles. No need to fuss with additional rust protectants.\nBumper-to-Bumper Limited Warranty\nThis warranty covers nearly everything that falls between your front and back bumper within the first 3 years or 36,000 miles of ownership. That means you\u2019re covered for components from air conditioning to suspension. And you may be surprised to learn that, unlike other manufacturers, Chevy also covers your tires under this generous warranty plan.\nAdditional Perks\nNot only will you enjoy a great warranty package, but you\u2019ll also enjoy a few extra perks over the competition! Chevy includes two complimentary maintenance visits, so you can keep your new purchase in top condition. Chevy also offers a 24-Hour Roadside Assistance Program with its Powertrain Limited Warranty, so you can drive with confidence through any scenario. This includes assistance with the following emergencies:\n\nTowing\nLockout\nFlat Tire\nJump Start\n\nTry Out a New Chevy Today!\nNow that you know what the Chevy warranty entails, why not take a brand new vehicle for a ride at Bowman Chevy?
