Taking its name from the top trim level from the Chevrolet C/K series, the Silverado is offered as a series of full-size pickup trucks, chassis cab trucks, and medium-duty trucks. The fourth generation of the model line was introduced for the 2019 model year.\nThe Chevrolet Silverado shares mechanical commonality with the identically related GMC Sierra; GMC ended the use of the C/K nomenclature a model generation prior to Chevrolet. In Mexico, high-trim level versions of the Silverado use the Chevrolet Cheyenne name (not to be confused with the 2003 concept). Competing against the Ford F-Series, Ram pickup, Toyota Tundra, and Nissan Titan, the Silverado is among the best-selling vehicles in the United States, having sold over 12 million trucks since its introduction in 1998 as a 1999 model year.[2]\nHistory[edit]\nThe Silverado nameplate made its debut for the 1975 model year, becoming the top trim level on all Chevrolet C/K trucks,[3] slotted above Custom Deluxe, Scottsdale, and Cheyenne. For the 1968 model year (seven years before the Silverado), GMC C/K trucks used variations of the Sierra name (Sierra, Sierra Classic, Sierra Grande, and High Sierra). Even after the C/K series officially ended, GM still uses the CK and the CC in their current model codes, to denote a two-wheel drive (CC), and four-wheel drive (CK).[4]\nFor the 1988 GMT400 model architecture, Chevrolet retained the C/K model nomenclature, with GMC branding its full-size line as Sierras. While sharing the same body and chassis, the model chronology of the Silverado and Sierra are different, with five generations of the Sierra, while four of the Silverado.\nIn 2018, at the NTEA Work Truck Show in Indianapolis, Indiana, Chevrolet unveiled the first medium-duty Silverado, expanding the model line to a 4500HD, 5500HD, and 6500HD chassis cab. Largely the successor to the 2003\u20132009 GMT560 chassis, the medium-duty trucks are exclusive to Chevrolet, with no plans for an equivalent GMC version. Instead, Navistar International (now partnering with GM) would sell the medium-duty trucks as a rebadged counterpart, called the CV. This is in fact a very similar nod to how the Avalanche did not have a GMC Yukon\u2013based equivalent, but instead, Cadillac would take its place as the former's rebadged counterpart, the Escalade EXT.\nFirst-generation Silverado / second-generation Sierra (GMT800; 1999)[edit]\nMain article: Chevrolet Silverado (first generation)\nFirst-generation Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD (2001\u201302 Regular Cab)\nThe GMT800 Silverado/Sierra 1500 and 2500 pickup trucks were released in August 1998 as 1999 models. The \"classic\" light-duty GMT400 C/K trucks continued to be produced for the first two years alongside the new models, and the Heavy-Duty GMT400 pickups (alongside the GMT400 SUVs) were continued until 2000, with the new GMT800 Silverado/Sierra HD (Heavy Duty) released a year later. A 3500 model was added later for 2001, with the introduction of the HD moniker (though it was not until the 2007 GMT900 model year a 3500HD debuted).\nThe trucks were refreshed in 2002 for the 2003 model year, bringing slight design changes and an upgrade to the audio and HVAC controls. The 2007 GMT800 trucks, built after the new GMT900 entered production, used the name Classic to denote the difference between the two generations.\nSecond-generation Silverado / third-generation Sierra (GMT900; 2007)[edit]\nMain article: Chevrolet Silverado (second generation)\nThis section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (February 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\nThird-generation GMC Sierra crew cab\nThe GMT900 generation of the Silverado/Sierra arrived in the last quarter of 2006 as a 2007 model. It features a redesigned exterior, interior, frame, and suspension as well as power increases on certain engines. Like the previous generation GMT800's and earlier C/K lines, it takes many styling cues from the GMT900 SUVs of the same year. Like the GMT900 SUVs, these pickups have improved aerodynamics over their predecessors thanks to steeply raked windshields and tighter panel gaps which help improve fuel economy. The previous GMT800 models were continued through 2007 badged as \"Classic,\" just as the GMT400 models continued for two years after the GMT800's introduction.\nThe new Silverado earned the North American Truck of the Year award for 2007 and was Motor Trend magazine's Truck of the Year for 2007.\nProduction continued until 2013.\nThird-generation Silverado / fourth-generation Sierra (GMT K2XX; 2014)[edit]\nThird generation\n2014 Silverado LTZ Crew Cab 4\u00d74\nOverview\nAlso\u00a0called \nChevrolet Silverado LD/GMC Sierra Limited (2019)\nProduction\n2013\u20132018 (1500)\n2014\u20132019 (HD)\n2018 (LD)\nModel\u00a0years \n2014\u20132018 (1500)\n2019 (1500 LD)\n2015\u20132019 (HD)\nAssembly  \nUnited States: Roanoke, Indiana (Fort Wayne Assembly); Flint, Michigan (Flint Truck Assembly)\nCanada: Oshawa, Ontario (Oshawa Car Assembly)\nMexico: Silao, Guanajuato (Silao Assembly)\nAustralia: Melbourne, Victoria (GM-Holden, RHD remanufacturing)\nDesigner    Kevin O'Donnell (2010)[5]\nBody and chassis\nPlatform    GMT K2XX\nPowertrain\nEngine  1500:\nLV3 EcoTec3 4.3 L V6 285\u00a0hp (213\u00a0kW; 289\u00a0PS)[6]\nL83 EcoTec3 5.3 L V8 355\u00a0hp (265\u00a0kW; 360\u00a0PS) (365\u00a0hp (272\u00a0kW; 370\u00a0PS) for Sierra All Terrain X)[6]\nL8B EcoTec3 5.3 L V8 355\u00a0hp (265\u00a0kW; 360\u00a0PS)[7]\nL86 EcoTec3 6.2 L V8 420\u00a0hp (313\u00a0kW; 426\u00a0PS)[6]\nHD:\nLY6 Vortec 6000 6.0 L V8 360\u00a0hp (268\u00a0kW; 365\u00a0PS)\nLML Duramax 6.6 L V8 (2015-16) 397\u00a0hp (296\u00a0kW; 403\u00a0PS)\nL5P Duramax 6.6 L V8 (2017-20) 445\u00a0hp (332\u00a0kW; 451\u00a0PS)\nTransmission    6-speed 6L80 automatic[6]\n6-speed 6L90 automatic\n8-speed 8L90 automatic\n6-speed Allison 1000 automatic[8]\nBattery 0.45 kWh lithium-ion (eAssist mild hybrid)\nDimensions\nWheelbase   Regular 6'6\": 119\u00a0in (3,023\u00a0mm)\nRegular 8': 133\u00a0in (3,378\u00a0mm)\nDouble 6'6\" & Crew 5'5\": 143.5\u00a0in (3,645\u00a0mm)\nCrew 6'6\": 153\u00a0in (3,886\u00a0mm)\nCrew 8': 167\u00a0in (4,242\u00a0mm)\nLength  Regular 6'6\": 205.6\u00a0in (5,222\u00a0mm)\nRegular 8': 224.4\u00a0in (5,700\u00a0mm)\nDouble & Crew 5'5\": 230\u00a0in (5,842\u00a0mm)\nCrew 6'6\": 239.6\u00a0in (6,086\u00a0mm)\nCrew 8': 258.3\u00a0in (6,561\u00a0mm)\nWidth   80\u00a0in (2,032\u00a0mm)\nHeight  73.5\u00a0in (1,867\u00a0mm) \u2013 74.2\u00a0in (1,885\u00a0mm)\nCurb\u00a0weight \n4,696\u20134,948\u00a0lb (2,130\u20132,244\u00a0kg) (Regular Cab)\n4,982\u20135,232\u00a0lb (2,260\u20132,373\u00a0kg) (Double Cab)\n5,036\u20135,300\u00a0lb (2,284\u20132,404\u00a0kg) (Crew Cab)\n[9]\nChronology\nPredecessor Cadillac Escalade EXT (for High Country)\nA blue 2014 Silverado LTZ Crew Cab 4\u00d74 similar to Steve McGarrett's truck from Hawaii Five-0; in the \"Kupu-eu\" episode\n2014 Silverado LTZ Double Cab 4\u00d74\nOn December 13, 2012, the fully-redesigned 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra were both introduced in Detroit, Michigan, later making their public debut at the North American International Auto Show. GM has now dropped the GMT900 platform, becoming \"K2XX.\" This generation of the Silverado/Sierra 1500 has three all-new gasoline engine options: a 4.3L EcoTec3 V6, a 5.3L EcoTec3 V8, and a 6.2L EcoTec3 V8, while dropping the 4.8L Vortec V8 from the last generation. Chevrolet's MyLink touch-screen multimedia interface system became available on most models. It included A2DP stereo streaming technologies, Bluetooth hands-free telephone, USB hookups, and an input for an Apple iPod or iPhone. A Bose premium audio system, as well as a Bose surround sound audio system, was available on most models. OnStar became standard on all models.\nUnderneath, the Silverado rides on a fully boxed high-strength steel frame with hydroforming technology; truck cab's frame is built with high strength steel as well. The third generation Silverado uses aluminum on the hood, for the engine block and for the control arms in order to save mass. The truck's bed is made of roll-formed steel instead of stamped steel used by other manufacturers in order to save weight and gain strength. The third generation Silverado introduced the all-new upmarket top-of-the-line \"High Country\" trim level which includes saddle brown leather interior, which is Chevrolet's very first entry into the luxury truck market since the 1955\u20131959 Task-Force 3100 \"Cameo Carrier.\" A fully-squared front fascia takes retro-modern styling cues from the GMT400 and 1981\u20131987 Square-Body trucks, and on Z71 models, a Z71 badge was added to the bottom right place of the grille. The first production Silverado completed assembly on April 29, 2013. The Silverado 1500 went on sale in May 2013 as a 2014 model, with the Silverado HD being available in early 2014 for the 2015 model year. On January 10, 2014, a recall was issued for 370,000 Silverado and Sierra pickups over a fire risk.[10]\nIn the U.S., the 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and 2015 2500HD/3500HD (as well as the latter's 2015 High Country) were introduced to the Philippines market by Chevrolet Motorama Show in late November 2014 for MY2015, along with the MY2015 Suburban, Tahoe, Impala, Express, Trax, and Colorado.\nOn January 14, 2014, the Silverado, along with the Corvette Stingray, received the 2014 North American International Auto Show's Car and Truck of the Year awards, respectively.[11]\nFor 2018, this generation of Silverado was officially exported to Australia and converted to right-hand-drive and Australian Design Rules (ADR) by General Motors Australian subsidiary, Holden Special Vehicles (HSV). In the past, several independent specialists imported and converted Silverados and Sierras for Australian and right-hand-drive markets. Only 2500HD and 3500HD models equipped with 6.6L Duramax diesel option were available. Neither gasoline engines nor 1500 series trucks were offered.[12][13]\n2015[edit]\nFor the 2015 model year, the 6.2L EcoTec3 is now paired with the new 8-speed 8L90 transmission, offering a wider ratio spread with more closely spaced gears, quicker shifts, improved acceleration, and fuel economy.[14] The Silverado 2500HD/3500HD models carried over the 6.0L L96 flex-fuel capable Vortec engine combined with the 6L90E transmission, installed with engine oil and transmission fluid coolers for hauling/towing applications. The 6.6L Duramax also continued to be backed by the 6-speed Allison 1000 automatic.[8][15] The 1500 Regular Cab Long Box model also became available from the factory without a pickup bed (i.e., as a chassis cab).[16] GM last offered its half-ton trucks as chassis cabs in 1980.\nThe GMC Sierra 2500HD/3500HD were the first \"heavy-duty\" trucks to offer an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), a Forward Collision Warning System (FCWS), and a Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS) available together as part of the available Driver Assist Package. The Driver Assist Package was standard equipment on the GMC Sierra 2500HD/3500HD Denali, and optional on most other Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD/3500HD and GMC Sierra 2500HD/3500HD models. Other new options for the Silverado and Sierra 2500HD/3500HD models included an eight-inch, full-color, reconfigurable LCD Driver Information Center (DIC) screen (for Sierra 2500HD/3500HD Denali models only), a 110-volt AC household-style power outlet, up to six available USB ports, an available eight-inch touchscreen infotainment system, and a power-sliding rear window with integrated defroster.\nIn mid-year 2015, Chevrolet and GMC made enhancements to the all-new Silverado 2500HD/3500HD and Sierra 2500HD/3500HD. Some of these enhancements included a new OnStar telematics system with 4G LTE Wi-Fi capabilities, new wheel designs, new exterior paint color options, new exterior tow mirror designs, a USB port added the glove compartment of trucks equipped with a front bench seat, DURALIFE brake rotors, the availability of dual 150 and 220 amp alternators for models equipped with the 6.6-liter Duramax Turbodiesel V8 engine, an off-road information screen added to the instrument cluster of 4\u00d74 models equipped with the Z71 or All-Terrain Packages (the latter is a GMC-only option), a Bi-Fi Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) option for models equipped with the 6.0L Vortec gasoline V8 engine, a new All-Terrain Package available on SLE and SLT Double Cab and Crew Cab models (for GMC models only), a standard heavy-duty locking rear axle for all models, and the removal of HD Radio from the \"up-level\" IO5 and IO6 infotainment systems. A Regular Production Option (RPO) Code of \"AVF\" in the upper glove compartment distinguishes early-build 2015 models from their 2015.5 successors.[17]\nSpecial Editions[edit]\nFor 2015, Chevrolet introduced a Special Edition for the Silverado truck series. They are in the following series of Rally Edition 1 and 2, Midnight Edition, Custom Sport Edition, Custom Sport Plus Edition, Black Out Edition, and Texas Edition.[18]\nRally Edition 1\nRally Edition 2\nBlack Out Edition\nTexas Edition\n2016 mid-cycle refresh[edit]\n2016 Chevrolet Silverado LTZ Z71\n2017 Chevrolet Silverado LT rear\nFor 2016, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 received a mid-cycle refresh. The refreshed Silverado and Sierra received a new grille, headlights, and front fascia, with design influences from the 2015 Chevrolet Colorado, as well as all-new LED taillights on the 2016 Silverado LTZ and High Country, 2016 GMC Sierra SLT and Denali trim levels while the 2016 Chevy Silverado LT trim levels and below still have the pre-facelifted incandescent taillights along with the 2016 GMC Sierra SLE trim levels and below. Silverado 1500 LTZ and High Country, as well as Sierra 1500 SLT and Denali models equipped with LED headlights, can be optioned with the Intellibeam high beam assist system. On October 1, 2015, HD Radio was added to the Silverado and Sierra to their 8-inch MyLink system as standard equipment on the LT and LTZ trims, while the Sierra included the feature in its IntelliLink system as standard on all its trims. 2016 Silverado and Sierra models optioned with the 8-inch touch screen featured Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability. Trucks ordered with bucket seats and center console now featured a wireless charging pad on the console lid.[19] New color options for the Silverado included Iridescent Pearl Tricoat (1500 only), Autumn Bronze Metallic, Siren Red Tintcoat, and Red Hot, while the Sierra's new colors included White Frost Tricoat (also 1500 only), Mahogany Metallic, Crimson Red Tintcoat, and Cardinal Red.\nChevrolet Special Edition[edit]\nFor that year, Chevrolet has added and dropped some of the Special Editions for the Silverado truck series. They are in the following series of Rally Edition 1 and 2, Midnight HD Edition, Midnight Edition, Custom Sport HD Edition, Realtree Edition, Custom Sport HD Edition, and Special Ops Edition.[18]\nCustom Sport HD Edition\nBlackout Edition\nMidnight HD edition\n2017[edit]\nFor the 2017 model year, Silverado and Sierra HD models were introduced with a new 6.6L Duramax turbo-diesel V8 (L5P) and received a new hood with air intake vents. Gasoline-powered models now have a capless fuel filler. The Sierra HD now included standard HID headlamps on all trim levels. New colors included Graphite Metallic and Pepperdust Metallic (Silverado) or Dark Slate Metallic and Pepperdust Metallic (Sierra). Jet Black/Medium Ash Gray interior trim is added for Silverado High Country. Low-speed mitigation braking is added to the Driver Alert Package for both Silverado and Sierra.[20]\nAll Silverado and Sierra models received minor changes to their MyLink (Chevrolet) and IntelliLink (GMC) infotainment systems. The interior backlighting on GMC Sierras changed from red to blue-green (or teal). Silverado and Sierra Double and Crew Cabs also received several new safety features, including GM's Rear Seat Reminder[21] and Teen Driver Mode.[22]\neAssist Mild Hybrid[edit]\nStarting in 2016, GM offered an eAssist mild hybrid version of the 5.3L V8 engine in the Silverado LT and Sierra SLT, but only in the state of California. The engine came with an 8-speed automatic transmission and had the same horsepower and torque as the standard version.[23] For 2017, it was also available in Hawaii, Oregon, Texas, and Washington. For 2018, it became available nationwide and was also offered in the Silverado LTZ.[24]\nSilverado SSV[edit]\nIn late 2014, Chevrolet released the 2015 Silverado SSV (Special Service Vehicle) to complement its lineup of law enforcement vehicles. The SSV Silverado was available in the 1500 Crew Cab with either the short (5.5') or standard (6.5') box. The 5.3L EcoTec3 V8 was the only engine option, and the SSV was based on the WT trim. It featured beefier brake rotors, upgraded oil coolers, high-output alternator, auxiliary battery, and an upfitter-friendly interior.[25]\nSpecial editions[edit]\nGMC[edit]\nIn 2016, GMC introduced the Sierra All Terrain X, which is equipped with a 5.3L V8 engine with performance exhaust, increasing power from 355 to 365 horsepower (265 to 272\u00a0kW; 360 to 370\u00a0PS). On the exterior, the Sierra All Terrain X features black 18\" rims fitted with larger 265/65R18SL Goodyear Wrangler Duratrac MT tires, black bed-mounted sport bar, LED off-road lights, and blacked-out accents.[26]\nAfter introducing the Sierra 1500 All Terrain X and Canyon All Terrain X, GMC extended the same formula to its heavy-duty pickup family with the Sierra HD All Terrain X in 2017. It was available on four-wheel-drive 2500 HD crew cab models and came in either Black Onyx or Summit White exterior colors.\nAll Terrain X models had a body-color grille surround and a grille insert that was unique to the All Terrain. Body-color door handles, front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, and black accents, including belt moldings, front bumper skid plate, and B-pillar accents, gave it a monochromatic appearance.\nSierra HD All Terrain X models also included 18\" black-painted aluminum wheels\u2014fitted with LT275/65R18 Goodyear Duratrac MT-rated tires\u2014along with four-inch black sport side steps, black heated and power-folding trailering mirrors with integrated turn signals and LED guidance lamps, a spray-on bedliner, and a black bed-mounted sport bar, which was designed to support available LED off-road driving lamps from GMC Accessories.\nInside, the All Terrain X had the GMC IntelliLink infotainment system with an 8-inch-diagonal color touchscreen, Teen Driver, remote-locking tailgate, remote starting system, Rear Vision Camera, adjustable pedals, leather-trimmed seats, heated front seats, and wireless mobile device charging.\nA 6.0L gasoline V8 engine was standard, with the 6.6L Duramax turbo-diesel delivering 445 horsepower (332\u00a0kW; 451\u00a0PS) and 910\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (1,234\u00a0N\u22c5m; 126\u00a0kg\u22c5m) of torque being optional.\nThe Sierra HD All Terrain X also included the Z71 off-road suspension package, adding front underbody and transfer case skid plates, twin-tube Rancho shocks, hill descent control, and off-road information graphics in the Driver Information Center. An Eaton automatically locking rear differential (4.10:1) was also standard.[27]\n2017[edit]\nSpecial Edition[edit]\nChevrolet[edit]\nThere were several additions to this year's Special Editions for the Silverado series shown in boldface. They are the following series of Midnight, Midnight HD, Rally 1, Rally 2, High Desert, Custom Sport HD, Realtree, Special Ops, Alaskan (available on HD series only), Redline, and Black Out. The remaining Special Edition listed in the 2017 Chevrolet Silverado brochure were All Star Edition and Texas Edition.\nNew for 2017 was the High Desert option package (with a plastic roll-bar inspired by the Avalanche sport utility truck). This package brought a new innovative lockable storage system into the bed of the Silverado 1500 Crew Cab model. The system included a three-piece hard tonneau cover, dual lockable storage bins on each side of the truck bed, and a removable bed divider to keep items separate and from moving around the truck bed while the vehicle was in motion. The High Desert package was available on both two-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive LT, LTZ, and High Country trim levels. It was not available on LTZ models with the Z71 off-road package. LT models with the High Desert package receive the same LED taillamps as the LTZ and High Country trims. Magnetic Ride Control was optional on High Country High Desert.\nAll Star Edition\nHigh Country High Desert Edition\nRally 2 Edition\nRedline Edition\n2018[edit]\n2018 GMC Sierra 3500HD Denali DRW\nSpecial Edition[edit]\nTo commemorate the 100th anniversary of the first Chevrolet truck, GM introduced special-edition models of the Chevrolet Silverado and the smaller Chevrolet Colorado.[28]\nChevrolet[edit]\nChevrolet introduced the Centennial Edition Chevrolet Silverado for 2018. Only available in a Crew Cab Short Box configuration with the LTZ Z71 trim, the Centennial Edition added a model-exclusive Centennial Blue Metallic color option, 22\" painted-aluminum wheels with chrome inserts, and special \"100 Years\" Chevrolet Bowtie emblems.[28] In addition to the Centennial Edition, the remaining Silverado Special Editions were virtually unchanged from the last year model.[18][29][30]\nCentennial Edition\nSpecial Ops Edition\nHD Midnight Edition\n2019 Silverado LD/Sierra Limited[edit]\nChevrolet continued production of the third-generation Silverado 1500 for 2019, which was sold alongside the all-new, fourth-generation 2019 Silverado 1500. Renamed the Chevrolet Silverado LD (\"LD\" for Light Duty), production of the previous-generation truck moved from Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Oshawa Car Assembly, Ontario, Canada. Only available in Double Cab/Standard Box configuration and with the 5.3L V8 engine, the Silverado LD ended production in December 2019.[31]\nIn retrospect, the first-generation Chevrolet Silverado 1500 was sold alongside its predecessor\u2014the fourth-generation C/K 1500\u2014for 1999, with the predecessor only being available with the V8 gasoline engine, automatic transmission, and the three-door extended cab/short bed configuration. It was also sold alongside the new-style second-generation Silverado for the 2007 model year as the Silverado Classic. GMC also offered versions of their Sierra trucks as the Sierra Classic for 1999 and 2007 as well, and did the same for 2019, offering the predecessor generation model as the Sierra 1500 Limited.[32]\nEngines[edit]\nModel   Year    Engine  Power   Torque\n1500    2014\u20132018   4.3 L LV3 GM EcoTec3 4300 V6    285\u00a0hp (213\u00a0kW; 289\u00a0PS) at 5300\u00a0rpm 305\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (414\u00a0N\u22c5m; 42\u00a0kg\u22c5m) at 3900\u00a0rpm\n2014\u20132019   5.3L L83 GM EcoTec3 5300 V8 355\u00a0hp (265\u00a0kW; 360\u00a0PS) at 5600\u00a0rpm 383\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (519\u00a0N\u22c5m; 53\u00a0kg\u22c5m) at 4100\u00a0rpm\n2016\u20132018   5.3L L8B GM EcoTec3 5300 V8 (eAssist)   355\u00a0hp (265\u00a0kW; 360\u00a0PS) at 5600\u00a0rpm 383\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (519\u00a0N\u22c5m; 53\u00a0kg\u22c5m) at 4100\u00a0rpm\n2014\u20132018   6.2L L86 GM EcoTec3 6200 V8 420\u00a0hp (313\u00a0kW; 426\u00a0PS) at 5600\u00a0rpm 460\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (624\u00a0N\u22c5m; 64\u00a0kg\u22c5m) at 4100\u00a0rpm\nHD  2015\u20132019   6.0L L96 Vortec 6000 V8 360\u00a0hp (268\u00a0kW; 365\u00a0PS) at 5400\u00a0rpm 380\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (515\u00a0N\u22c5m; 53\u00a0kg\u22c5m) at 4400\u00a0rpm\n2015\u20132016   6.6L LML Duramax V8 397\u00a0hp (296\u00a0kW; 403\u00a0PS) at 3200\u00a0rpm 765\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (1,037\u00a0N\u22c5m; 106\u00a0kg\u22c5m) at 1600\u00a0rpm\n2017\u20132019   6.6L L5P Duramax V8 445\u00a0hp (332\u00a0kW; 451\u00a0PS) at 2800\u00a0rpm 910\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (1,234\u00a0N\u22c5m; 126\u00a0kg\u22c5m) at 1600\u00a0rpm\nFourth-generation Silverado / fifth-generation Sierra (GMT T1XX; 2019)[edit]\nFourth generation\nOverview\nAlso\u00a0called HSV Chevrolet Silverado (Australia)\nGMSV Chevrolet Silverado (Australia)\nProduction  July 2018 \u2013 present (1500)\nMay 2019[33] \u2013 present (2500, 3500)\nModel\u00a0years 2019\u2013present (1500)\n2020\u2013present (2500, 3500)\nAssembly  \nUnited States: Roanoke, Indiana (Fort Wayne Assembly); Flint, Michigan (Flint Truck Assembly)\nCanada: Oshawa, Ontario (Oshawa Car Assembly)\nMexico: Silao, Guanajuato (Silao Assembly)\nAustralia: Melbourne, Victoria (GMSV Australia, RHD remanufacturing)\nDesigner    Tyler Moffett (2015)[34]\nBody and chassis\nPlatform    GMT T1XX\nRelated Chevrolet Colorado (third generation)[35]\nPowertrain\nEngine  L3B 2.7L Turbocharged I4\nLV3 EcoTec3 4.3L V6 (2019\u20132021)\nL82 EcoTec3 5.3L V8 (2019-2021)\nL84 EcoTec3 5.3L V8\nL87 EcoTec3 6.2L V8\nLM2 Duramax Diesel 3.0L I6\nLZ0 Duramax Diesel 3.0L I6\nTransmission    6-speed MYC 6L80 Automatic (2019\u20132021)\n6-speed 6L90 automatic (2020-2023)\n8-speed 8L90 automatic\n10-speed Hydra-Matic 10L80 MF6 automatic\n10-speed Allison 10L1000 MGM/MGU automatic\nDimensions\nWheelbase \nRegular Cab: 126.5\u00a0in (3,213\u00a0mm)\nDouble/Crew Cab: 147.4\u00a0in (3,744\u00a0mm)\nLength\nRegular 6'6\": 210.7\u00a0in (5,352\u00a0mm)\nRegular 8': 229.5\u00a0in (5,829\u00a0mm)\nDouble: 231.8\u00a0in (5,888\u00a0mm)\nCrew 5'8\": 231.7\u00a0in (5,885\u00a0mm)\nCrew 6'6\": 241.2\u00a0in (6,126\u00a0mm)\nWidth   81.2\u00a0in (2,062\u00a0mm)\nHeight  75.4\u201375.8\u00a0in (1,920\u20131,930\u00a0mm)\n78.2\u201378.5\u00a0in (1,990\u20131,990\u00a0mm) (Trail Boss)\nCurb\u00a0weight Silverado 1500\n4,474\u20134,686\u00a0lb (2,029\u20132,126\u00a0kg) (Regular Cab)\n4,793\u20135,007\u00a0lb (2,174\u20132,271\u00a0kg) (Double Cab)\n4,798\u20135,008\u00a0lb (2,176\u20132,272\u00a0kg) (Crew Cab)\n[36]\nOn December 16, 2017, Chevrolet unveiled the all-new, fourth-generation 2019 Silverado 1500 at its Chevy Truck Centennial Celebration Weekend at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, Texas.

For its debut, the Silverado 1500 was airlifted via a helicopter onto a stage, where it was introduced to a crowd of Chevrolet truck owners and enthusiasts, as well as to the automotive press. Chevrolet NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. also spoke at the event. In addition to the reveal of the 2019 Silverado 1500, multiple Chevrolet trucks of different generations were on display as well.[37]\nThe model shown at the reveal was the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LT Trail Boss, an all-new trim level added to the lineup, and is a factory-modified version of the Silverado 1500 LT Z71. Distinguishing features of the Trail Boss from other Silverado 1500 trim levels are its gloss black front fascia, black rear step bumper, black Chevrolet \"bow-tie\" emblems on the front grille and rear tailgate, 18-inch gloss black-finished aluminum-alloy wheels, large off-road tires, altered suspension, \"Trail Boss\" decals on the sides of the bed, front bumper-mounted center fog lamps, \"Z71\" emblems on each front fender, and red-painted front tow hooks.\nThe formal unveiling of the Silverado 1500 took place at the 2018 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan on January 13, 2018, exactly 100 years after Chevrolet delivered its first trucks to customers on January 13, 1918. The model was unveiled as a Silverado LT Trail Boss model.\nSales to customers began in August 2018 as an early 2019 model year vehicle with a base price of $32,200 MSRP.[38][39]\nThe Silverado 1500 features a more sculpted exterior design, with headlamps that integrate into the grille (similar to more recent Ford trucks), and the former also incorporates LED Daytime Running Accent Lamps (DRL's).[37] Coincidentally, both brought in an all-new 10-speed automatic transmission.\nFor the 2020 model year, the Silverado 1500 has been launched in Australia for the first time. Holden Special Vehicles (known as General Motors Specialty Vehicles since 2021) has started the conversion to right-hand-drive and Australian Design Rules. The 6.2L V8 engine is the sole engine choice at the launch.[40][41]\nTrims[edit]\nAs of 2019, the Silverado 1500 was planned to be available in eight distinct trim levels: WT, Custom, Custom Trail Boss, LT, RST, LT Trail Boss, LTZ, and High Country.[42]\nAll trim levels include a next-generation touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth for hands-free calling and wireless audio streaming via A2DP, power windows and door locks (on Double and Crew Cab models), air conditioning, and a rearview backup camera system. Additional features available on select trim levels include GPS navigation, SiriusXM Satellite Radio and Travel Link, OnStar with 4G LTE in-vehicle Wi-Fi, a Bose premium audio system with seven speakers, keyless access and push-button start, a remote starter system, heated and ventilated luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces, a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, driver-assist technologies, a multi-angle camera system, and heated rear seats.\nSpecial Editions[edit]\nFor 2020, the Rally and Midnight Special Editions returned after being absent for the 2019 model year. Rally Edition was available on the Silverado Custom and RST trims. The package featured black Rally Stripes on the hood and tailgate, black CHEVROLET tailgate lettering, and black assist steps. The Midnight Edition featured Bucket Seats with Console, special headlamp bezels, black dual exhaust tips, and black assist steps. The Midnight Edition was only available on the LT Trail Boss trim level.[43]\nAlso in 2020, Chevrolet and Realtree announced that there would be a 2021 Silverado 1500 Realtree Edition. This was the second time Chevrolet and Realtree teamed up to produce a special edition Silverado, having done so in 2016. The 2021 model was based on a Silverado 1500 Custom Trail Boss in Crew Cab Short Box configuration, adding 20-inch black wheels and Realtree camouflage graphics inside and out.[44] Ultimately, only seven examples came to exist to the public in the United States.[citation needed]\nEngines[edit]\nRear view\nInterior\nThe all-new 2019 Silverado and Sierra 1500 offers a choice of six different engine options, dependent upon trim level. The base engine on lower trim levels is the 285-horsepower (213\u00a0kW; 289\u00a0PS), 4.3-liter EcoTec3 E85-capable V6 gasoline engine. Standard on mid-level trims is an all-new, 310-horsepower (231\u00a0kW; 314\u00a0PS), 2.7-liter turbocharged inline-four gasoline engine (thus being the smallest engine available on a GM full-size half-ton pickup), and features cylinder deactivation for improved fuel economy. Optional on most trim levels is the 355-horsepower (265\u00a0kW; 360\u00a0PS), 5.3-liter EcoTec3 V8 gasoline engine, which is optionally E85 capable, and features either a carryover Active Fuel Management (AFM) system, or a brand-new Dynamic Fuel Management system (DFM), which now can shut off two, three, four, five, or six of eight cylinders. The availability of either AFM or DFM is dependent on trim level, with WT and Custom trucks available with AFM, and LT and above trucks standard with DFM. Optional on upper-level trims is a 420-horsepower (313\u00a0kW; 426\u00a0PS), 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V8 gasoline engine with Dynamic Fuel Management (DFM). An also all-new, 277-horsepower (207\u00a0kW; 281\u00a0PS) 3.0-liter turbocharged Duramax I6 engine became available for the 2020 model year. Availability of this engine had been delayed because of EPA certification. All engines are paired to either a 6-speed, 8-speed, or 10-speed automatic transmission, with a choice of either two-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive (the latter being standard equipment on Silverado 1500 Custom Trail Boss and LT Trail Boss trims, and optional on all other Silverado 1500 and Sierra 1500 models). For 2020, availability of both the 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V8 gasoline engine and the 10-speed automatic transmission will expand to most Silverado 1500 and Sierra 1500 trim levels.\nAccording to EPA ratings, 2WD 2019 Silverado models with the 2.7-liter turbo inline-4 engine can achieve 20\u00a0mpg\u2011US (12\u00a0L/100\u00a0km; 24\u00a0mpg\u2011imp; 8.5\u00a0km/L)/23\u00a0mpg\u2011US (10\u00a0L/100\u00a0km; 28\u00a0mpg\u2011imp; 9.8\u00a0km/L) city/highway.[45]\nModel   Year    Engine  Power   Torque\n1500    2019\u20132021   4.3 L LV3 GM EcoTec3 4300 V6    285\u00a0hp (213\u00a0kW; 289\u00a0PS) @ 5300 RPM  305\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (414\u00a0N\u22c5m; 42\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 3900 RPM\n2019\u20132021   2.7 L L3B Turbocharged I4   310\u00a0hp (231\u00a0kW; 314\u00a0PS) @ 5600 RPM  348\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (472\u00a0N\u22c5m; 48\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 1500 RPM\n2022\u2013   2.7 L L3B Turbocharged High Output I4   310\u00a0hp (231\u00a0kW; 314\u00a0PS) @ 5600 RPM  420\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (569\u00a0N\u22c5m; 58\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 1500 RPM\n2020\u20132022   3.0 L LM2 Duramax I6    277\u00a0hp (207\u00a0kW; 281\u00a0PS) @ 3750 RPM  460\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (624\u00a0N\u22c5m; 64\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 1500 RPM\n2023\u2013   3.0 L LZ0 Duramax I6    305\u00a0hp (227\u00a0kW; 309\u00a0PS) @ 3750 RPM  495\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (671\u00a0N\u22c5m; 68\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 1500 RPM\n2019\u20132021   5.3 L L82 GM EcoTec3 5300 V8    355\u00a0hp (265\u00a0kW; 360\u00a0PS) @ 5600 RPM  383\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (519\u00a0N\u22c5m; 53\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 4100 RPM\n2019\u2013   5.3 L L84 GM Ecotec3 5300 w/DFM V8  355\u00a0hp (265\u00a0kW; 360\u00a0PS) @ 5600 RPM  383\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (519\u00a0N\u22c5m; 53\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 4100 RPM\n2019\u2013   6.2 L L87 GM EcoTec3 6200 w/DFM V8  420\u00a0hp (313\u00a0kW; 426\u00a0PS) @ 5600 RPM  460\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (624\u00a0N\u22c5m; 64\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 4100 RPM\n2500HD/3500HD   2020\u2013   6.6 L L8T V8    401\u00a0hp (299\u00a0kW; 407\u00a0PS) @ 5200 RPM  464\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (629\u00a0N\u22c5m; 64\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 4000 RPM\n2020\u20132023   6.6 L L5P Duramax V8    445\u00a0hp (332\u00a0kW; 451\u00a0PS) @ 2800 RPM  910\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (1,234\u00a0N\u22c5m; 126\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 1600 RPM\n2024\u2013   6.6 L L5P Duramax V8    470\u00a0hp (350\u00a0kW; 477\u00a0PS) @ 2800 RPM  975\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (1,322\u00a0N\u22c5m; 135\u00a0kg\u22c5m) @ 1600 RPM\nInfotainment system[edit]\nStandard features include a next-generation infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The Waze mobile app can now be compatible in its infotainment system through the use of CarPlay.[46]\nA seven-inch infotainment system is standard on Chevrolet Silverado 1500 WT, Custom, and Custom Trail Boss models, as well as the GMC Sierra 1500 Base (Sierra) model, while an eight-inch infotainment system is standard on the Silverado 1500 LT, LT Trail Boss, RST, LTZ, and High Country models, as well as the Sierra 1500 SLE, SLT, AT4, and Denali. SiriusXM Satellite Radio, OnStar with 4G LTE Wi-Fi, a seven-speaker Bose premium audio system, HD Radio, GPS navigation, SiriusXM Travel Link, and a multi-angle camera system are all available depending upon the trim level selected. For 2020, Silverado and Sierra models add SiriusXM 360L compatibility.\nPayload and towing[edit]\nCrew cab Silverado models increased in payload by up to 14 percent, or 340 pounds (150\u00a0kg).[47]\nTrailering features equipped for the 2019 model included an industry-first VIN-specific trailering and payload label and an in-vehicle towing app on its GM infotainment system.[48]\nVariants[edit]\nChevrolet Silverado HD[edit]\nSilverado HD LTZ\nChevrolet released three all-new 2020 Silverado models, including the Silverado 2500 HD and 3500 HD, in 2019.[49] Chevrolet debuted the truck at GM's Flint, Michigan plant on February 5, 2019.[50][51] The trucks had made their arrival at the dealerships in the late summer of 2019.\nPayload and towing[edit]\nThe 2020 Silverado 3500 HD can tow up to 35,500 pounds (16,100\u00a0kg) in a regular cab dual rear wheel configuration with the Duramax 6.6L L5P turbodiesel V8 engine.[52]\nGMC Sierra[edit]\nThe fifth-generation GMC Sierra was unveiled in Detroit on March 1, 2018. The Sierra 1500 differentiates itself from its Chevrolet Silverado 1500 counterpart by offering unique features, such as a two-piece tailgate, a pickup bed constructed from carbon fiber, a 3-by-7-inch (7.6\u00a0cm \u00d7\u00a017.8\u00a0cm) multi-color head-up display, a rearview mirror backup camera system, and a luxury Denali trim level. The Sierra 1500 also features its own distinct exterior styling, though interior styling is similar to that of the Chevrolet Silverado 1500.[53]\nThere are six functions of GMC Sierra's Multi-Pro Tailgate including a primary tailgate load stop for large items. Its inner tailgate can be a load stopper, a full-width step, and a work area by dropping down the load stop or provide easy access to the bed just by folding down the inner tailgate.[54]\nPowertrains include improved versions of the current 5.3-liter and 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V8 gasoline engines, as well as the same 3.0-liter Duramax turbocharged diesel I6 engine that is also available in the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500. An all-new, ten-speed automatic transmission comes as standard equipment on gasoline-powered Sierra 1500 models. Availability of the previous 4.3-liter EcoTec3 V6 gasoline engine was not announced at launch.\nAll trim levels included a next-generation touch screen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth for hands-free calling and wireless audio streaming via A2DP, power windows and door locks (on Double and Crew Cab models), air conditioning, and a rearview backup camera system. Additional features available on select trim levels included GPS navigation, SiriusXM Satellite Radio and Travel Link, OnStar with 4G LTE in-vehicle Wi-Fi, a Bose premium audio system with seven speakers, keyless access and push-button start, a remote starter system, heated and ventilated luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces, a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, driver-assist technologies, a multi-angle camera system, and heated rear seats.\nThe 2019 GMC Sierra went on sale in September 2018 as an early 2019 model year vehicle at GMC dealerships nationwide. The Sierra 1500 will be planning to launch in Australia and New Zealand in the 3rd Quarter of 2024 and assembled in GMSV Australia RHD Conversion.[55]\nSierra 1500 SLE\nSierra 1500 SLE rear\nSierra 1500 AT4\nSierra 1500 Denali interior\nSierra 2500 Denali\nSierra 2500 Denali rear\nRegular Cab[edit]\nNot initially available at launch, the all-new 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 regular cab configuration went on sale in early 2019. Initially only available with an 8-foot (2.4\u00a0m) pickup box, with a choice of two-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive and the 4.3-liter EcoTec3 V6 or 5.3-liter V8 gasoline engines, the regular cab is exclusively available in the WT trim (1WT) for Silverado 1500, or the Sierra (1SA) trim for Sierra 1500. The regular cab option is not available in other trim levels in the United States and Canada, as these trucks are geared mainly towards fleet and commercial buyers. Although regular cab models with a 6.5-foot (2.0\u00a0m) bed and in higher trim levels actually are produced, they are only available for sale in Mexico and the Middle East. Starting in 2022, regular cab models with a 6.5-foot (2.0\u00a0m) bed were made available in the United States and Canada, albeit only in WT trim and with the 2.7L L4 engine.\nStandard features include a black front grille, black front and rear bumpers, 17\" steel wheels, manual windows and door locks, manual black side mirrors, a seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with rearview backup camera and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, vinyl seating surfaces, a split front bench seat, vinyl flooring, and air conditioning. Options include the Chrome Appearance Group (17\" aluminum-alloy wheels and chrome front and rear bumpers), OnStar 4G LTE in-vehicle Wi-Fi capabilities, cloth seating surfaces, carpeted flooring with floor mats, and the Power Equipment Group (power windows and door locks, keyless entry, power black side mirrors, and cruise control).[56]\nThe 1500 Regular Cab Long Box model is also available from the factory without a bed (i.e., as a chassis cab). GM last offered its half-ton trucks as chassis cabs in 1980. [citation needed]\n2020 changes[edit]\nThe 2020 Silverado saw the deletion of the Oakwood Metallic exterior paint color. Aside from the 3.0 L Duramax, major additions were new vertical trailering mirrors, which include power adjustability, as well as power-folding and power-extension capabilities. Adaptive cruise control was optional on the LTZ and High Country trim levels, and SiriusXM 360L capability was available on LT and higher trims. The Silverado 1500 also deleted the keyless access buttons on the rear doors.\nThe Sierra saw a new Carbon Black Metallic paint color in addition to the above-mentioned Silverado updates.\n2020 was the final model year for 1500 Double Cab models in LTZ, SLT, and AT4 trims.\n2021 changes[edit]\nFor 2021, the Silverado and Sierra pickups saw relatively few changes. Most notably, the Silverado 1500 offered the newly named Multi-Flex six-position tailgate, which was borrowed from the GMC Sierra, and the introduction of wireless CarPlay and Android Auto projection capability. The 2.7-liter 4-cylinder and 3.0-liter Duramax diesel\u2013equipped Silverado and Sierra models saw increased towing capacity ratings and new towing technology, including a jack-knife alert and trailer length indicator. Several colors were changed on the Silverado: Havana Brown Metallic and Cajun Red Tintcoat were replaced by Oxford Brown Metallic and Cherry Red Tintcoat, respectively, and Mosaic Black Metallic is a new addition. 2021 Sierra models received color changes as well; Deep Mahogany Metallic, Red Quartz Tintcoat, and Carbon Black Metallic are replaced with Brownstone Metallic, Cayenne Red Tintcoat, and Ebony Twilight Metallic, respectively. Smokey Quartz Metallic was removed from the available color options and Hunter Metallic was added as a new paint color. For the 2021 Sierra, the previously unnamed \"Sierra\" trim officially became \"Pro.\"\nForward Collision Alert, Automatic Emergency Braking, and Front Pedestrian Braking options were now available on Silverado WT and Custom trim levels as part of the Safety Confidence Package. Crew Cab Standard Box Sierra 1500 models were now only available in four wheel drive.[57]\nSilverado and Sierra 3500 HD DRW models saw an increase in maximum towing capacity to 36,000 pounds (16,000\u00a0kg).[58]\nDue to the global microchip shortage, some 2021 Silverado and Sierra vehicles were built without options like automatic start-stop and heated and ventilated front seats, heated outboard rear seats, and heated steering wheel.[59]\n2022 changes[edit]\nThe 2022 Silverado LTD and Sierra Limited entered the model lineup as a stop-gap measure until production of the newly-refreshed 2022 model began. As such, the 2022 Silverado LTD and Sierra Limited had very few changes from the 2021 models.\nNotable changes for the 2022 Limited models included the discontinuation of both the 4.3-liter LV3 EcoTec3 V6 and 5.3-liter L82 EcoTec3 V8 with active fuel management (AFM) gasoline engines, as well as the previous \"6L80\" six-speed automatic transmission, leaving only the 8-speed and 10-speed available. The LT Trail Boss trim-level (Chevrolet) was now available with the 3.0-liter Duramax turbodiesel engine.[60] The 5.3L V8 is now no longer available on the Sierra 1500 Limited AT4.\n2022 refresh[edit]\nFor the 2022 model year, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 receives a mid-cycle refresh that includes the following new trim levels for the Chevrolet Silverado, called the ZR2, and for the GMC Sierra, called the AT4X and Denali Ultimate. The refresh also includes a new front-end design, as well as a revised interior. All trucks equipped with front bucket seats receive a new center console-mounted transmission shift lever (trucks equipped with a front bench seat retain the previous column-mounted gear selector lever). The 3.0-liter Duramax turbocharged diesel engine now has expanded availability on more trim levels. The 5.3L V8 is not available on Sierra 1500 AT4 models once again.\nThe short 6.5-foot (2.0\u00a0m) pickup box option has returned for the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 Regular Cabs since last being offered in the US market on the previous generation from 2018. The current generation version, which was previously only available in Mexico and the Middle East, is only available in the U.S. market with the WT and Pro trims of the Silverado and Sierra, respectively. Other trim levels like RST and Trail Boss for the Silverado and Elevation and AT4 for the Sierra have been available with this configuration in the Middle East since 2019 but are not offered in the U.S. Base Silverado 1500 WT and Sierra 1500 Pro Regular Cab models now received standard power windows, door locks, and push-button start,[61] although keyless entry remained an extra-cost option. All models from the LT (Silverado) and SLE (Sierra) and above received a newly standard 13.4-inch touchscreen infotainment system, which included wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration and SiriusXM Satellite Radio with 360L (up-level models also receive connected GPS navigation), while base models retained the previously-standard seven-inch touchscreen display. A new Silverado 1500 ZR2 model became the most off-road capable model in the lineup, while a new Sierra 1500 Denali Ultimate was now the top-tier trim of the lineup, which also received a new premium Bose surround sound audio system with an amplifier, subwoofer, and genuine metal speaker grilles. Top-tier Silverado and Sierra models received the General Motors Super Cruise semi-autonomous driving system, allowing for hands-free driving on most highways, and all models received more standard safety equipment.\nChevrolet also introduced a new trim level to this series, the ZR2, which slotted between High Country and LTZ.[62][63] GMC models receive a similar, though more upscale model known as AT4X.[64]\nThe refreshed 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 began shipping to dealerships in the spring of 2022. Both brands also sold the outgoing models of both trucks, named the Silverado 1500 LTD and Sierra 1500 Limited respectively, alongside the new models. Only 1500 (half-ton) models of both trucks were refreshed for 2022, with a refresh of the heavy-duty (2500HD and 3500HD) trucks following in 2024.\nIn April 2023, GM introduced the 2500HD version of the ZR2, a new heavy-duty off-road model, as well as a special edition called the ZR2 Bison, in partnership with parts supplier American Expedition Vehicles. CNBC noted it was another sign of a trend where automakers grew their off-road models to increase profits.[65]\n2022 Silverado 1500 LTZ front\n2022 Silverado 1500 LTZ rear\n2022 Silverado 1500 interior\n2024 Sierra 1500 Elevation front\n2022 Sierra 1500 Elevation rear\n2022 Sierra 1500 interior (standard)\n2022 Sierra 1500 interior (Denali Ultimate)\nSafety[edit]\nSitting higher than other consumer vehicles, the Chevrolet Silverado has significantly larger blind spots in which people or other cars are invisible to the driver.[66] According to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Silverado is the second most likely car to be involved in a fatal crash.[67]\nThe 2022 Silverado 1500 LTD Crew Cab was tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS):\nIIHS Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LTD Crew Cab:[68]\nCategory    Rating\nSmall overlap frontal offset (Driver)   Good\nSmall overlap frontal offset (Passenger)    Marginal\nModerate overlap frontal offset Good\nSide impact (original test) Good\nRoof strength   Good\nHead restraints and seats   Good\nHeadlights  Poor\nFront crash prevention (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) Superior    optional\nSeat belt reminders Poor\nChild seat anchors (LATCH) ease of use  Marginal\nSilverado EV[edit]\nMain article: Chevrolet Silverado EV\nIn April 2021, GM President Mark Reuss announced Chevrolet would be building an electric variant of the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 pickup truck at the Factory ZERO complex in Detroit. The vehicle will have a targeted range of 400 miles.[69] The vehicle was unveiled in January 2022 at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The vehicle has been built from the ground up as a fully electric pickup by using a battery electric platform shared with the GMC Hummer EV, instead of using the existing Silverado platform.[70] Production will start in the Factory ZERO assembly plant (formerly Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly) in the second quarter of 2023.[71]\nMedium duty version (4500HD, 5500HD, 6500HD, and International CV)[edit]\nMedium duty\nOverview\nAlso\u00a0called Chevrolet Silverado MD\nInternational CV\nProduction  2018\u2013present\nModel\u00a0years 2019\u2013present\nAssembly    Springfield, Ohio (Navistar)\nPowertrain\nEngine  L5D Duramax Diesel 6.6 L V8[72]\nTransmission    6-speed Allison A1700/A2700 automatic[72]\nDimensions\nWheelbase \nRegular Cab: 141\u2013243\u00a0in (3,581\u20136,172\u00a0mm)\nDouble/Crew Cab: 175\u2013235\u00a0in (4,445\u20135,969\u00a0mm)\n[72]\nLength\nRegular Cab: 224.5\u2013360.0\u00a0in (5,702\u20139,144\u00a0mm)\nCrew Cab: 258.7\u2013344.2\u00a0in (6,571\u20138,743\u00a0mm)\n[72]\nWidth   84.0\u00a0in (2,134\u00a0mm)[72]\nHeight  82.5\u201386.4\u00a0in (2,100\u20132,190\u00a0mm)[72]\nCurb\u00a0weight \n4500HD: 7,507\u20138,815\u00a0lb (3,405\u20133,998\u00a0kg)\n5500HD: 7,507\u20138,814\u00a0lb (3,405\u20133,998\u00a0kg)\n6500HD: 7,560\u20139,307\u00a0lb (3,429\u20134,222\u00a0kg)\n[72]\nFor the 2019 model year,[73] General Motors released the medium-duty Silverado 4500HD/5500HD/6500HD, joining the Chevrolet LCF 3500/4500/5500 model line (derived from the Isuzu NPR) and succeeding the prior Chevrolet Kodiak and GMC TopKick. Competing against the Ford F-450/550/650 and Ram 4500/5500, the model line spans Class 4\u20136 trucks, with GVWR ranging from 14,001 to 23,500\u00a0lb (6,351 to 10,659\u00a0kg).[74] Unlike the previous Kodiak/TopKick line, which was discontinued in 2009, GM markets the medium-duty Silverado line exclusively as a Chevrolet with no GMC equivalent;[75] along with a lack of divisional support for the segment, GM is seeking to rebrand the current GMC line as premium vehicles.\nHistory[edit]\nThe medium-duty Silverado was co-developed with Navistar, which sells a rebadged variant as the International CV (Commercial Vocational); the CV replaces the International D series and as well as the International TerraStar.[76] GM developed the powertrain, while Navistar was responsible for the chassis.[77] With the exception of grilles and badging, both model lines are identical. Navistar assembles both lines at its Springfield, Ohio facility,[78] using cabs assembled by Navistar in Springfield.[79]\nGM unveiled the medium-duty Silverado line at the NTEA Work Truck Show in March 2018.[80][81] Navistar unveiled the CV Series that November,[77] and production began in December.[82]\nDesign[edit]\nIn contrast to smaller Silverado pickup trucks, the 4500HD/5500HD/6500HD and CV are only offered as a chassis cab vehicle intended for modification by upfitters/body builders, typically by adding specialized rear bodywork. The frame rails have been designed to ease installation for upfitters.[83] It is marketed with two-door or four-door cabs and either rear-wheel or four-wheel drive, using a gear-driven transfer case. The hood tilts forward for easier access to the engine and for routine service.[76] GM have designated the model as the GM515 or GM51P, depending on the end use, with the GM51P used for incomplete passenger bus chassis.[84]\nBoth the Silverado medium-duty and CV are powered by a 350 horsepower (260\u00a0kW), 700\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (950\u00a0N\u22c5m) variant of the Duramax 6.6L V8 diesel engine[83] paired with an Allison 1000 or 2000 series automatic transmission.[85][86] There is also a diesel exhaust fluid filling port by the passenger's side door.[76]\nAvailable wheelbase and cab-to-axle dimensions[84][87]\nCab-to-axle Body    Wheelbase   Overhang\nFront   Rear 49\u00a0in (1,245\u00a0mm)   Rear 63\u00a0in (1,600\u00a0mm)   Rear 75\u00a0in (1,905\u00a0mm)   Rear 91\u00a0in (2,311\u00a0mm)\n60\u00a0in (1,524\u00a0mm)    Regular Cab 141\u00a0in (3,581\u00a0mm) (standard 2WD)    34\u00a0in (864\u00a0mm)   Yes     Yes     No  Yes\nCrew Cab    175\u00a0in (4,445\u00a0mm) (standard)     Yes     No  No  No\n84\u00a0in (2,134\u00a0mm)    Regular Cab 165\u00a0in (4,191\u00a0mm) (standard 4WD)     Yes     Yes     No  Yes\nCrew Cab    199\u00a0in (5,055\u00a0mm)    Yes     Yes     No  No\n104\u00a0in (2,642\u00a0mm)   Crew Cab    219\u00a0in (5,563\u00a0mm)    No  No  Yes     No\n108\u00a0in (2,743\u00a0mm)   Regular Cab 189\u00a0in (4,801\u00a0mm)    Yes     Yes     Yes     No\n120\u00a0in (3,048\u00a0mm)   Regular Cab 201\u00a0in (5,105\u00a0mm)    Yes     Yes     Yes     No\nCrew Cab    235\u00a0in (5,969\u00a0mm)    No  No  Yes     No\n138\u00a0in (3,505\u00a0mm)   Regular Cab 219\u00a0in (5,563\u00a0mm)    No  Yes     No  No\n150\u00a0in (3,810\u00a0mm)   Regular Cab 231\u00a0in (5,867\u00a0mm)    No  No  No  Yes\n162\u00a0in (4,115\u00a0mm)   Regular Cab 243\u00a0in (6,172\u00a0mm)    No  No  Yes     No\nThe front wheels can turn by up to 50 degrees to enhance maneuverability.[76]\nSales[edit]\nAt its launch, GM introduced the model line primarily through its dealer network that specialized in fleet and commercial truck sales, known as the 'Business Elite' program, alongside an additional limited number of selected dealerships.[88]\nSilverado 6500HD with dump bed\nInternational CV\nMilitary applications[edit]\nLSSV\nOverview\nManufacturer    General Motors\nAM General\nModel\u00a0years 2001\u2013present\nBody and chassis\nBody\u00a0style  2-door SUV\n4-door SUV\n2-door pickup\n4-door pickup\nPlatform    GM GMT880 platform\nPowertrain\nEngine  6.6 L Duramax V8\nTransmission    4-speed 4L80-E automatic\n5-speed Allison 1000 automatic\nDimensions\nWidth   79.9\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m)\nHeight  74.5\u00a0in (1.89\u00a0m)\nLSSV[edit]\nWhen production of the CUCV II ended in 2000, GM redesigned it to coincide with civilian truck offerings. The CUCV nomenclature was changed to Light Service Support Vehicle (LSSV) in 2001. In 2005, LSSV production switched to AM General, a unit of MacAndrews and Forbes Holdings. The LSSV is a GM-built Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD, Chevrolet Tahoe, or Chevrolet Suburban that is powered by a Duramax 6.6 liter turbo diesel engine. The various Silverados, Tahoes, and Suburbans that are used provide numerous platforms for different kinds of vehicles. As GM has redesigned its civilian trucks and SUVs from 2001\u2013present, LSSVs have also been updated cosmetically.[89]\nThe Militarization of standard GM trucks/SUVs to become LSSVs includes exterior changes such as CARC paint (Forest Green, Desert Sand, or 3-color Camouflage), blackout lights, military bumpers, a brush guard, a NATO slave receptacle/NATO trailer receptacle, a pintle hook and tow shackles. The electrical system is changed to the 24/12-volt military standard. The dashboard has additional controls and data plates. The truck also can be equipped with weapon supports in the cab, cargo tie down hooks, folding troop seats, pioneer tools, winches, and other military accessories.[89]\nThe Enhanced Mobility Package (EMP) option adds enhanced suspension, 4-wheel anti-lock brakes, a locking differential, on/off-road bead-lock tires, a tire pressure monitoring system and other upgrades. About 2,000 LSSV units were sold to U.S. and international military and law enforcement organizations.[89]\nVariants[edit]\nCargo/Troop Carrier Pickup (2-door, Extended Cab, or 4-door Silverado)\nCargo/Command Vehicle (4-door Tahoe)\nCargo/Troop/Command Vehicle/Ambulance (4-door Suburban)\nZH2[edit]\nZH2 Chevrolet Silverado\nOverview\nManufacturer    General Motors\nModel\u00a0years 2018\u2013present\nBody and chassis\nBody\u00a0style  2-door pickup\nPowertrain\nEngine  GM Hydrotec Fuel Cell Electric\nGeneral Motors relaunched the GM Defense division in 2018 offering the ZH2 Silverado, an advanced technology Chevrolet Silverado with a hydrogen-powered fuel cell and a heavy-duty truck architecture modified for next generation military vehicle needs.

Whether you\u2019re tackling tough jobs on the worksite, embarking on weekend adventures, or simply running errands during your day-to-day, the Silverado 1500 offers the versatility and performance you need. As your local truck dealer, we have a wide range of Silverado 1500s, each with a collection of features designed to enhance your driving experience. The Chevy Silverado is built to handle whatever life throws your way.\nThe Chevy Silverado 1500 is well known and has become a symbol of American strength, durability, and innovation since its debut in 1999. Born from Chevrolet\u2019s rich heritage in producing reliable and powerful trucks, the Silverado quickly established itself as a favorite among truck enthusiasts and professionals. With each new generation, the Silverado 1500 continues to evolve, surpassing the expectations of the public while staying true to its roots as a dependable and capable truck. Whether you\u2019re looking for power, versatility, or cutting-edge technology, the Chevy Silverado 1500 remains the top dog in the competitive world of full-size pickup trucks.\nOff-Road Capability\nThere are plenty of reasons one might need a Chevy Silverado 1500, and one of those reasons is its off-road capabilities. The truck has become more equipped for off-road life than ever before. From rugged trails, muddy paths, or steep inclines, the Silverado 1500 is built to handle the challenges of off-road driving with ease. With the available Z71 Off-Road Package, the Silverado 1500 transforms into a robust off-road machine, ready to take on the toughest terrains. This package includes a host of features that enhance the truck\u2019s off-road performance, ensuring that you can confidently explore wherever the road\u2014or lack thereof\u2014takes you.\nAvailable Packages\nThe Z71 Off-Road Package is an off-road enthusiast\u2019s dream come true, offering a suite of features specifically designed to tackle rugged conditions. With a specially tuned off-road suspension that absorbs the impact of rough terrain, you get a smoother and more controlled ride even on the bumpiest trails. Rancho monotube shocks work within the suspension to improve handling and stability during off-road driving. These shocks are built to withstand the harsh conditions of off-roading, offering durability and performance.\nThe Silverado 1500, with the available Z71 Off-Road and Protection Package, comes equipped with an automatic locking rear differential, which improves traction by locking the rear wheels together when wheel slippage is detected. This is particularly useful in muddy, sandy, or snowy conditions, where maintaining grip is crucial. This feature ensures you can keep going as long as you want to. Other features, such as Skid Plates, help protect the underbody from rocks, debris, and other obstacles. These tough steel plates keep critical components like the oil pan and transfer case safe, giving you peace of mind when navigating rocky terrain.\nThe Z71 is just one example of the available off-road options on the Silverado 1500. The Trail Boss options are incredible, as are the ZR2 trim and, for even more off-road capability, the ZR2 Bison Edition. Chevy has taken leaps and bounds in the off-road market, making it easier for everyone to get an affordable vehicle that can easily tackle trails and more. If you enjoy adventure, then you need a Chevy Silverado 1500.\n\nTowing and Hauling Capabilities\nSometimes, it\u2019s all about work, sometimes it\u2019s about play, and with the right truck, you can have both. That is when you need the Chevy Silverado 1500. Renowned for its robust towing and hauling capacity, the 1500 offers plenty of capability and technology for both work and play. With multiple engine options, advanced towing technologies, and a well-engineered design, this truck is built to meet the demands of any heavy-duty task. This could mean towing a trailer for work or hauling some outdoor toys for a weekend of fun in the sun.\nThe Silverado 1500 offers a variety of powerful engines, each designed to provide the performance needed for serious towing and hauling. Which engine you have access to and what kind of power it pumps out just depends on what model year and trim option you go for, but rest assured that Chevy has been stacking the 1500 with some impressive power since the beginning. Beyond the available engine options, such as the 2.7L TurboMax turbocharged I-4, the 5.3L V8, and the 3.0L Duramax turbo-diesel I-6 that can tow up to 13,300 lbs, the Silverado 1500 is also heavily loaded with towing and hauling technologies.\nTrailering Camera Views\nFor example, the available trailering camera system found on some of the recent trim options provides up to 14 different camera views, giving you a comprehensive view of your surroundings when towing. This system includes features like a Hitch View, Bed View, and a Transparent Trailer View, which helps you see behind the trailer as if it weren\u2019t there. This technology works like magic to make towing and hauling so much easier and safer.\nTrailering Safety Technology\nTo enhance safety while towing, the Silverado 1500 offers Trailer Sway Control, which automatically applies the brakes and reduces engine power if the system detects that your trailer is swaying. This helps keep your trailer stable and under control, even in challenging driving conditions. This means the winds can be blowing hard, and the roads can be littered with potholes, but you are good for the long haul.\nThe Chevy Silverado 1500 has been proving its strength since day one, offering nearly unmatched towing and hauling abilities. Plus, with the addition of the latest technologies each passing year, the Silverado stays modern and up-to-date. If you like to play hard or work hard, or maybe even a bit of both, then you need the Chevy Silverado 1500.\nAmenities for Comfort and Convenience\nThere used to be a time when trucks were merely designed for labor, so comfort was not prioritized, but that was a long time ago, and now comfort and convenience are as important as ever. As more and more families are choosing trucks for their comfortable cabins and advanced safety features, Chevy has stepped it up by giving the 1500 plenty of features designed to enhance comfort and convenience. When it comes to selecting the right truck, the Chevy Silverado 1500 is a truck you need if you want one that has the best of both comfort features and dependable capability.\nThe Chevy Silverado 1500 prioritizes your comfort and convenience, from its spacious and thoughtfully designed interior to its range of modern amenities. The cab of the 1500 is well known for being crafted to provide ample space for both the driver and passengers, with generous legroom and headroom that make even long journeys comfortable. Cabs are available in an assortment of sizes, so if space is what you want, you can have it. Whether you opt for the crew cab, double cab, or regular cab, the Silverado 1500 offers a layout that will work for you.\n\nComfortable Seating Options\nSpace doesn\u2019t mean much if it isn\u2019t properly utilized, which is why the Silverado 1500 offers available premium seating options, including leather-appointed seats, heated and ventilated front seats, and 10-way power-adjustable driver and passenger seats. These features let you and your passengers customize their comfort and feel like they are home even when on the road. If that wasn\u2019t enough, the Silverado 1500 is also decked out with loads of infotainment technologies that further the appeal of owning one of these trucks.\nImpressive Infotainment\nThe Silverado 1500 is equipped with a suite of advanced technology features that enhance convenience and connectivity, such as the Chevrolet Infotainment System. Each generation of the infotainment system has proven its worth, offering such features as a large touchscreen display and smartphone integration. The 2024 Chevy Silverado 1500 even sports an impressive 13.4-inch touchscreen for all our infotainment needs. Other premium options, such as Wireless Charging and mobile hotspot capabilities are just a few more amenities that make the Silverado 1500 so great.\nThe Whole Package\nThe Chevy Silverado 1500 has been impressing us for some time now, offering a vehicle that hits all the right notes.

You can choose from rear- and four-wheel drivetrains on most trim levels, haul loads, and tow your playthings when you\u2019re up for adventures.\nThe new Chevy Silverado 1500 builds on the previous year\u2019s model, bringing the same performance and reliability that make it one of America\u2019s most popular full-size trucks.  \nYou can choose from nine trim levels, most of them offered in standard rear-wheel drive and ready for anything from casual daily driving to heavy-duty work across job sites. Four-wheel drive is optional across all trims except for the Trail Boss, a trim offered exclusively in four-wheel drive and optimized for the off-road.\nVersatile Cab and Bed Options\nWhen it comes to cab style and bed length options, the 2025 Silverado 1500 spoils you with choices. Designed for work, the regular cab style offers standard seating for three and can be had with a standard 79.44-inch bed or a long bed with a length of 98.18 inches. The former offers 71.7 cubic feet of cargo volume, whereas the long bed boasts 89.1 cubic feet.  \nFor bigger crews, you can choose the double cab, paired exclusively with a standard bed and equipped with seating for six. If you need a family hauler or adventure companion, the crew cab style is your best option. This style can be had with front bucket seats or a front bench, offering a seating capacity for five to six riders with ample legroom and ergonomic seats at the rear. The crew cab can be paired with a standard bed or a short 69.92-inch bed.\nPowerful Performance\nBeyond style and bed length, you can choose from a range of powerful engines. Standard on most trims, a TurboMax engine delivers 310 horsepower, 430 lb-ft of torque, and great fuel economy thanks to the efficient eight-speed automatic transmission.  \nFor greater towing power or off-road performance, you can pick between a 5.3L or 6.2L EcoTec3 V8 engine, both paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission. A 3.0L Duramax turbo diesel engine is also available, delivering 305 horsepower and 495 lb-ft of torque for a towing capacity of up to 13,300 lbs when properly equipped with the Max Trailering Package.\nTech for Work and Play\nEach Silverado 1500 trim level also comes packed with modern technologies, including the Chevrolet Infotainment 3 system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility, Wi-Fi hotspot capability, and Bluetooth phone control, meaning you can stay in touch with your crew or loved ones without taking your hands off the steering wheel.  \nOn select trims, the available Chevrolet Infotainment 3 Premium system brings a larger touchscreen and Google built-in so you can access additional entertainment and connectivity features.  \nTo explore this full-size truck, visit us at Charlevoix Chevrolet in Charlevoix, MI to take it for a spin.\nPosted in Charlevoix Chevrolet Dealer | Comments Off on Meet the 2025 Chevy Silverado 1500: Strength and Reliability\nConnect with us\n\nArchives\n\nJanuary 2025\nDecember 2024\nNovember 2024\nOctober 2024\nSeptember 2024\nAugust 2024\nSeptember 2023\nMay 2023\nApril 2023\nJune 2022\n\nCategories\n\nCharlevoix Chevrolet Dealer\nCharlevoix Chevrolet Service\nUncategorized\n\nMeta\n\nLog in\nEntries feed\nComments feed\nWordPress.org\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2025 by\u00a0DealerOn\u00a0|\u00a0Sitemap\u00a0|\u00a0Privacy\u00a0|\u00a0Charlevoix Chevrolet\u00a0|\u00a006684 US-31 S,\u00a0Charlevoix,\u00a0MI\u00a049720\u00a0|\u00a0Sales: 231-486-5795\n"

    "raw_content": "Published Time: 2024-10-04T18:35:56+00:00\nThe Best and Worst Years of the Chevy Silverado 1500 - Municibid Blog\n\n\n\nPodcast\nVehicles\nLandscaping Equipment\nHeavy Equipment\n\nOctober 4\nThe Best and Worst Years of the Chevy Silverado 1500\nTrucks, Vehicles\nLast Updated on December 17, 2024\nThe Chevrolet Silverado 1500 has been a part of the full-size pickup truck market for decades. These Chevy trucks are renowned for their exceptional towing capabilities, powerful engine options, and rugged durability. However, like all vehicles, certain model years stand out for their reliability. Others have garnered notoriety for having persistent issues.\nWhether you\u2019re in the market for a new or used Silverado, or simply curious about the truck\u2019s evolution, understanding which generations are better and which are worse can help you make informed decisions. Let\u2019s explore the best Chevy Silverados\u2026 and some of the worst.\nBest Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Model Years\nMany of the Silverado 1500 model years are fantastic choices for those seeking a dependable and capable full-size pickup truck.\n2005 and 2006 Silverado\nThese model years from the first generation are some of the most reliable and trouble-free Silverado models to date. With fewer reported issues compared to their contemporaries, the 2005 and 2006 models offer a solid combination of power, capability, and dependability.\n2007 Silverado\nIf you purchase a used 2007 Chevy Silverado, you can expect great things. This award-winning pickup truck offers improved powertrain options, a comfortable interior, and fewer reported issues than many other Silverado models.\n2019 \u2013 Present Silverado Models\nThe latest variations of the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 are currently being praised for their overall quality, advanced features, and reliable performance. Their strong engines offer decent gas mileage and have received few complaints. Thus far, any current-generation Silverado model would make an excellent choice for work or for leisure.\n\nOne of the worst model years for the Chevy Silverado 1500 was 2014.\nWorst Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Model Years\nWhile the Silverado 1500 has enjoyed a reputation for durability and reliability, certain model years have become infamous among buyers.\nLooking for vehicles near you?\nWe'll email you with vehicles up for auction near you and featured auctions.\n2002 Silverado\nThis model year from the first generation is notorious for engine and brake malfunctions. Specific complaints cited excessive oil consumption, faulty engine cooling, and other dangerous malfunctions.\n2012 and 2013 Silverado\nThese models are among the worst years in the Silverado 1500\u2019s second generation. Consumers complained about transmission, engine, and interior accessory problems. If you\u2019re considering buying a used truck, count these models as some of the Chevy Silverado 1500 years to avoid.\n2014, 2015, 2017 Silverado\nAll three of these year models come from the third generation; they\u2019re the three most complained about Chevrolet Silverado models to date. These are the Chevy Silverado 1500 years to avoid, without question. Think twice about buying a used truck from any of these iterations. You\u2019re likely to find electrical issues, rusted brake lines, problems with the intake manifold, and so many more issues it\u2019s difficult to name them all.\n\nThis Chevy Silverado 1500 comes from the very first generation.\nFirst Generation: The Groundwork (1999-2006)\nThe first generation Silverado in 1999 marked a transition from the long-running\u00a0\u201cC/K\u201d series pickups, popular in the 1960s. This new generation offered a modern, refined, and more comfortable interior, yet still retained the ruggedness and capability expected from full-size trucks. Also included were\u00a0driver message centers and Vortec V8 engines.\nWhile the early years of this generation (1999-2003) were generally well-received, some owners reported issues with the automatic transmission and excessive oil consumption. The\u00a02002 model year\u00a0stands out as particularly problematic, with numerous complaints related to the brakes, engine, and fuel system. The latter part of this generation (2004-2006) saw improvements in overall reliability with no major problems. The 2006 model, in fact, is cited by some as one of the best years for the first generation Silverado, evidenced by a decrease in consumer complaints.\n\nThis model comes from the second generation of the Chevy Silverado 1500.\nSecond Generation: Refinement and Power (2007-2013)\nThe second generation of the Silverado 1500, introduced in 2007, brought significant enhancements to interior quality, safety features, and powertrain options. This generation saw powerful engine choices, including the capable 6.2-liter V8. And unlike the previous generation, this one made use of\u00a0two and four-wheel drivetrains. Buyers were so pleased with this next Chevy Silverado that the 2007 model year won\u00a0North American Truck of the Year.\nHowever, the later years of this generation (2012-2013) were plagued by various issues. The\u00a02012 model year\u00a0encountered plenty of transmission, engine, and interior accessory problems. The\u00a0following model year had more of the same problems, and if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, it received a higher number of complaints surrounding the vehicle body and paint.\n\nThe third generation of the Chevy Silverado 1500 came with a fresh design and new features.\nThird Generation: Modern Refinement, Modern Problems (2014-2018)\nThe third generation Silverado 1500 came in 2014. It brought a fresh design, improved fuel efficiency, and a host of advanced technology features to the market. General Motors introduced a new EcoTec3 engine, which resulted in stronger performance and fuel economy.\nHowever, these four years did not produce the most reliable Chevy Silverado models. The earliest years (2014-2015) were an unmitigated disaster for the Silverado. The\u00a02014 version\u00a0has some of the highest number of complaints in Chevy history. The Silverado released the following year had fewer complaints, but is still the second highest complained-about model in the vehicle\u2019s history. There were air conditioning problems, engine problems, transmission complaints, and many more complaints. The list goes on.\nResults did improve somewhat for the Silverado model years that followed. The 2016 model experienced less complaints, and the 2018 model experienced the least within this generation. But both still reported the same problems, as well as certain electrical problems, steering wheel concerns, and brake failure.\nIn comparison to other trucks, this generation of Chevrolet Silverados 1500 were neither ideal family vehicles nor work trucks. These were the Chevy Silverado 1500 years to avoid. However, change was on the horizon.\nFourth Generation: The Current Era (2019-Present)\nThe pickup trucks of the fourth generation were brought to consumers in 2019. Unlike older models, these Silverado models boast a more aggressive exterior, a more spacious and technologically advanced interior, and a range of powertrain options. Examples would be the powerful 6.2-liter V8 and a fuel-efficient turbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine.\nWhile the reliability of this latest generation is still too new to definitively assess, none of them have a poor rating, which means the best years for the Chevy Silverado could be soon to come. The pickup truck with the worst rating this generation is the\u00a02019 model, and the complaints somewhat surpass the 2018 model. After that, the numbers drop.\nThe latest Chevrolet Silverado lineup has been generally well-received, with owners praising the truck\u2019s performance and overall quality.\n\nOne of the best model years for the Chevy Silverado 1500 was 2007.\nCommon Issues and Potential Problems\nChevrolet Silverado models all come with their fair share of pros and cons, some of which have repeated throughout the generations. If you\u2019re looking to buy one, car dealerships should supply you with all the relevant information for your desired vehicle. However, aside from making sure you take the truck for a test drive, also be on the lookout for these common problems:\nTransmission Problems\nThe Silverado\u2019s most notorious for transmission problems\u2013 they\u2019re the most common issues with the brand, and they can have several causes. The most common issues include the car bucking or jerking, the car shuddering, hard shifts between gears, or general \u2018jerkiness\u2019. Some of the more severe transmission problems include losing the ability to go into first or fourth gear, the transmission entering \u201climp home\u201d mode (which restricts the car to second and third gear or reverse gear), and the car suddenly downshifting into first gear.\nThese transmission issues can be caused by failed shift solenoids or by issues with the software in the car\u2019s PCM. Model years particularly affected include 2002, 2012, and 2017. Chevrolet\u2019s even faced several recalls thanks to these problems.\nExcessive Oil Consumption\nMany owners have reported excessive oil consumption, particularly in the early model years of each generation. This issue can be caused by various factors, including faulty piston rings, valve guides, or other engine components.\nOne of the most common causes, however, is faults with the Generation 4 Vortec engine and its Active Fuel Management system. The AFM system is supposed to disable engine cylinders when you\u2019re not using them to help you save gas. Unfortunately, it was faulty, especially in the years between 2010 and 2014, which are definitely some of the Chevy Silverado model years to avoid. The flaws in the system meant that oil would frequently end up in the combustion chamber. It would get burned up, and your Silverado would chug oil like a Captain Planet villain.\nIt\u2019s normal for a high mileage engine to go through fuel quickly and inefficiently. But the Generation 4 Vortec engine is bad enough, even when it\u2019s relatively new, that you want to take precautions to avoid these oil issues. You can get an aftermarket device that plugs into your engine and disables the AFM system. If the AFM hasn\u2019t already damaged your engine, this device can keep it from doing so. General Motors also recommends changing your valve cover with an updated design to help with the oil problems.\nFuel System Issues\nAll trucks can have fuel issues; it\u2019s the nature of the internal combustion engine. But the Chevy Silverado 1500 has some special fuel system issues, thanks, once again, to the AFM system.\nThe oil problems are the first horseman of the Silverado apocalypse. They lead to much, much worse problems later on. Leaking oil passes through the pistons and accumulates on the engine\u2019s cylinders, reducing the engine\u2019s horsepower and damaging the engine. If you\u2019re particularly unlikely, it can even lead to a misfire.\nThe AFM system is really only a problem in second and third generation Silverados, and it\u2019s worth pointing out that most Silverados that featured the AFM don\u2019t have serious problems. The AFM\u2019s failures are a pretty serious flaw with the truck model, but most Chevy Silverados won\u2019t experience problems with it. This isn\u2019t the Ford Pinto.\nHydraulic Valve Lifter Issues\nA hydraulic valve lifter controls a car engine\u2019s valves, regulating how much gas is going into the engine. If it fails, the valve will get stuck and stay closed, and then your car won\u2019t start. It\u2019s the automotive equivalent of a heart attack. Worse, a collapsed lifter can hit the camshaft, tearing off tiny metal shavings that can cause some real damage to your engine. And the AFM system makes Chevy Silverados more prone to hydraulic valve lifter issues.\nIf you\u2019re having hydraulic valve lifter issues, you might hear a \u2018tick\u2019 or \u2018chirp\u2019 sound from your engine. Your car might not start easily; it might misfire or stall. You might see a \u201ccheck engine\u201d prompt on your dashboard. If you\u2019re really unlucky, your car might give out in the middle of an intersection. So, if your Chevy Silverado starts \u2018ticking\u2019, that\u2019s a ticking time bomb; get it to the mechanic immediately.\nElectrical System Issues\nElectrical system problems, such as faulty sensors, wiring issues, and malfunctioning electronics, have been reported across various model years. The most common sensor issues are in the oil pressure gauge. When damaged, it might display an oil pressure of zero, or flash the \u201ccheck oil\u201d light repeatedly.\nBut all the other dashboard gauges (including, worryingly, the speedometer) are prone to issues. You might hit a bump and have your entire dash turn off, or have the battery light turn on even when your car is fully charged. These issues are generally caused by faulty motors in the sensors or by bad solder connections. Thankfully, it\u2019s an easy fix for a mechanic.\nThe 2012, 2014, and 2016 models are most prone to these issues. Since they\u2019ve already got the Generation 4 Vortec engine, these are definitely some of the Chevy Silverado 1500 years to avoid.\nWindow Issues\nThe Chevy Silverado has some commonly reported issues with windows. One common issue is that the power windows will stop working. This can be caused by some of the electrical issues we mentioned earlier- bad solder connections, faulty motors, or damaged switches. It can also be caused by a broken window regulator (the part of the vehicle that actually moves the windows up and down), but this is less common. This isn\u2019t a serious issue, but it\u2019s one you need to address in case your vehicle\u2019s electrical system has more serious issues.\nAnother common window issue is that the rear windows may start to leak. This is commonly caused by faulty window seals or a bad gasket around the brake light. If you find water on the back seat of your car, or are seeing wet carpets and water staining, you should take your car to the mechanic. Compared to some of the issues on this list, it\u2019s a minor problem, but again, it can show more serious problems in the car\u2019s electrical system.\nAll in all, being aware of these potential problems can help you, as the prospective buyer, make informed decisions and budget wisely.\n\nDespite having various repeat issues, the Chevy Silverado 1500 has been a mainstay in the automotive industry.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhen considering the purchase of a used Chevrolet truck, potential buyers often have questions regarding reliability, common issues, and which Chevy Silverado 1500 years to avoid. Here are some frequently asked questions and their answers:\nWhich Silverado models have transmission problems?\n2002 Silverados and Silverados from the 2012-2017 model years had the most transmission-related complaints. Vehicles from the fourth generation have mostly avoided this issue.\nWhich Silverado engine is most reliable?\nWhile engine reliability can vary based on maintenance and driving conditions, the 5.3-liter V8 and the 6.2-liter V8 engines are generally regarded as some of the most reliable and durable options in the Silverado lineup.\nWhich Silverado engine is least reliable?\nIf you\u2019re looking to buy a Chevy Silverado, you want to avoid the Generation 4 Vortec engine. The Gen 4 Vortec is a 5.3-liter V8, and those are normally quite reliable\u2013 but its Active Fuel Management system causes many, many problems. The AFM system is a major factor in why the 2012 and 2014 Silverado model years are notorious for engine problems. You want to avoid a Gen 4 Vortec engine at all costs\u2013 any Chevy Silverado 1500 year model with a Gen 4 Vortec engine is one of the Chevy Silverado 1500 model years to avoid.\nWhich year 5.3 engine should I stay away from?\nThe Generation 4 Vortec engine is the least reliable V8 engine used in Chevy Silverados. Its AFM system causes problems with the engine, the fuel system, and sometimes even the e makes the third generation Silverados some of the Chevy Silverado 1500 model years to avoid.\nIs it better to buy a used or new Silverado?\nWhile a new Silverado offers the latest features and a full warranty, a well-maintained used model can still provide excellent value and reliability, but at a lower cost.\nThe oldest models of Silverado are extremely reliable and have already lasted for two full car generations. The models made between 2010 and 2020, however, have design flaws that make them less reliable\u2013 the AFM system, in particular, might give you problems if you\u2019re planning to use your Silverado as a family vehicle.\nBut either a used or new Silverado can be a great purchase, if you\u2019re careful and do your research. What you ultimately decide should depend on your budget and intended use.\nHow many miles can a Silverado 1500 typically last?\nA Silverado 1500 can easily\u00a0last 200,000 miles. However, the longevity of the truck depends on various factors, including driving conditions, load hauling, and maintenance history.\nWhat is the most common problem with Chevy Silverado trucks?\nTransmission issues and excessive oil consumption are among the most commonly reported problems with Chevy Silverado trucks. These issues are often caused by the Gen 4 Vortec engine\u2019s Active Fuel Management system, and if you can pick up a Silverado that doesn\u2019t use it, you\u2019ll be happier in the long run.\nSilverados are also prone to engine problems and various concerns with the electrical system.\nWhich is better, a Silverado 1500 or Ram 1500?\nThe choice between a Silverado and a Ram 1500 often comes down to intended use and specific features desired. Both trucks offer capable performance, a range of powertrain options, and various trim levels to suit different needs and budgets. It\u2019s worth noting that some of the Chevy Silverado\u2019s worst years were some of the Ram 1500\u2019s best. But the Silverado and the Ram are equally reliable, and when they do break down, they can both suffer from transmission and engine issues. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preferences.\nWhich is better, a Silverado 1500 or a Ford F-150?\nAgain, the choice between a Silverado 1500 and a Ford F-150 often comes down to personal preferences. They\u2019re approximately equal in terms of performance, features, and reliability. One factor you may want to take into account is that some of the Chevy Silverado\u2019s worst years were some of the Ford F-150\u2019s best. If you\u2019re interested in a used car from 2014, the Ford F-150 is the way to go; conversely, if you\u2019re interested in a used car from 2006, you want the Chevy Silverado.\nConclusion\nThe Chevrolet Silverado 1500 has a rich history and a loyal following among truck enthusiasts and professionals alike. While certain model years have garnered praise for their reliability and overall quality, others have been marred by persistent complaints that make them the Chevy Silverado 1500 years to avoid.\nIf you\u2019re considering a used Silverado 1500, do your research. Look into the specific model year, know its issues, and figure out vehicle\u2019s maintenance history. Consulting reliable sources, such as owner forums, expert reviews, and reliability ratings, can provide valuable insights and help you make an informed decision.\nBy understanding the best and worst years for the Silverado 1500, as well as the most common issues to watch out for, you can increase your chances of finding a reliable and capable truck that meets your needs and expectations.\nIf you\u2019re looking to find a\u00a0pickup truck\u00a0that is used and well-maintained, one great place to start looking is with Municibid!

    "raw_content": "Published Time: 2025-02-22T23:56:14+00:00\nAre Chevy Silverados Reliable? A Comprehensive Review of Performance\n\n\n\nPodcast\nVehicles\nLandscaping Equipment\nHeavy Equipment\n\nFebruary 22\nAre Chevy Silverados Reliable?\nTrucks, Vehicles\nLast Updated on February 22, 2025\nWhen it comes to full-size pickup trucks, the Chevrolet Silverado has long been a popular choice among American consumers. As with any vehicle purchase, reliability is a crucial factor to consider. So, are Chevy Silverados reliable? Let\u2019s dive into the data, expert opinions, and owner experiences to get a clear picture of the Chevrolet Silverado\u2019s reliability.\nReliability Metrics\n\nTo understand the Chevrolet Silverado\u2019s reliability, we can assess three key metrics: cost, frequency of repairs, and severity of issues.\nCost\nThe average annual repair cost for a Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is $714. This figure is significantly lower than the industry average of $936 for full-size trucks. When considering long-term ownership costs, this difference can add up to substantial savings over the years.\nFrequency of Repairs\n\nSilverado owners can expect to bring their trucks in for unscheduled repairs about 0.2 times per year. This is lower than the average for full-size trucks, indicating Chevrolet Silverados tend to be more reliable in terms of frequency of unexpected repairs.\nSeverity of Issues\nThe probability of a Silverado needing a major repair is about 16%. While this is slightly higher than the average for all vehicle models (12%), it\u2019s actually better than the average for full-size trucks (18%). This suggests that when issues do occur with Chevrolet Silverados, they\u2019re less likely to be severe compared to other trucks in its class, leading to fewer complaints.\nFactors Affecting Reliability\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the Chevrolet Silverado\u2019s overall reliability:\nBuild Quality\nChevrolet has a reputation for solid build quality in their trucks. The Silverado\u2019s body-on-frame construction and high-strength steel frame contribute to its durability and longevity.\nEngine Performance\n\nChevrolet Silverados offer a range of engine options, from V6 to V8 and even diesel variants. Generally, these engines are known for their reliability and performance. The 5.3L V8, in particular, has a strong reputation for longevity.\nLooking for vehicles near you?\nWe'll email you with vehicles up for auction near you and featured auctions.\nMaintenance Requirements\n\nRegular maintenance is crucial for any vehicle\u2019s reliability. Chevrolet Silverados have relatively straightforward maintenance needs, but staying on top of oil changes, tire rotations, and other routine services is essential for long-term reliability.\nFirst-Year Model Issues\nAs with many vehicles, first-year models of new Chevrolet Silverado generations can sometimes experience more issues as new technologies and designs are implemented. It\u2019s often wise to wait for a year or two after a major redesign before purchasing.\nNew Technology Integration\n\nWhile new technologies can enhance the driving experience, they can also introduce new potential points of problems. Chevrolet Silverados with more advanced features may require more specialized maintenance and repairs.\nEngine Reliability\n\nThe Chevrolet Silverado offers several engine options, each with its own reliability profile:\nV6 Engines\nThe base V6 engines in Chevy Silverados are generally reliable and fuel-efficient. They\u2019re a good choice for those who don\u2019t need maximum towing capacity when considering the truck\u2019s performance.\nV8 Engines\nThe 5.3L and 6.2L V8 engines are known for their durability and power. Many owners report these engines lasting well over 200,000 miles with proper maintenance.\nDiesel Engines\nThe Duramax diesel engines in Chevy Silverado HD models have a strong reputation for reliability and longevity. However, they do require more specialized maintenance. Common engine-specific issues include:\n\n\nExcessive oil consumption problems in some model years, particularly 2010-2014\n\n\nIssues with the Active Fuel Management (AFM) system in certain V8 engines\n\n\nTransmission Reliability\n\nTransmission problems have been a concern for some Chevy Silverado model years:\n6-Speed Automatic\nEarlier model years with the 6-speed automatic transmission have had some reported issues, particularly in the 2015 model year (third generation Silverado).\n8-Speed Automatic\nThe 8-speed automatic, introduced in 2015, has had mixed reviews. Some owners have reported shifting problems and premature wear compared to the previous generation.\n10-Speed Automatic\nThe newer 10-speed automatic, co-developed with Ford, has generally received positive feedback for its smooth operation and reliability. There are a few things you can do to improve transmission reliability, including:\n\n\nRegularly change transmission fluid according to the manufacturer\u2019s schedule\n\n\nAvoid overloading the truck beyond its rated capacities\n\n\nIf towing frequently, consider adding an auxiliary transmission cooler\n\n\nResale Value and Depreciation\n\nReliability plays a significant role in a vehicle\u2019s long-term value, and the Chevy Silverado holds its own in terms of resale value. While trucks generally depreciate at a slower rate than sedans or SUVs, Silverado values can vary based on factors such as mileage, condition, and model year.\nKey factors influencing the Silverado\u2019s resale value include:\n\n\nModel Year: Newer models with improved technology and efficiency often retain value better than older versions with outdated features.\n\n\nTrim Level and Features: Higher trims with advanced technology, safety features, and premium materials tend to hold value longer.\n\n\nMaintenance and Service History: A well-documented service record boosts resale value, showing potential buyers that the truck has been properly maintained.\n\n\nMarket Demand: Silverado trucks are consistently in demand, especially in regions where full-size pickups are popular for work or recreation.\n\n\nOverall, the Chevrolet Silverado offers strong resale value, making it a solid investment for buyers who plan to sell or trade in their truck down the line.\nGet a Great Deal on a Used Chevy Silverado with Municibid\n\nLooking for a reliable, affordable way to buy a used Chevy Silverado or any other vehicle?

Many report their Chevy Silverados lasting well over 200,000 miles with minimal issues, while others have faced frustrating problems early on. It\u2019s important to note that negative experiences often get more attention online, which can skew perceptions.\nLongevity and Durability\n\nWith proper maintenance, a Chevy Silverado can easily last 200,000 miles or more. Many owners report their trucks still running strong well beyond this milestone. Factors that contribute to a Chevy Silverado\u2019s longevity include:\n\n\nRegular maintenance following the manufacturer\u2019s schedule\n\n\nAddressing issues promptly when they arise\n\n\nUsing high-quality parts and fluids\n\n\nAvoiding excessive wear from overloading or harsh driving conditions\n\n\nLong-term reliability considerations include:\n\n\nRust prevention, especially in areas with harsh winters\n\n\nSuspension component wear, which can be accelerated by heavy loads or off-road use\n\n\nEngine and transmission longevity, which can vary based on use and maintenance\n\n\nComparison to Competitors\n\nWhen compared to other similar-sized trucks, the Chevy Silverado holds its own in terms of reliability:\n\n\nFord F-150: Generally considered equally reliable, with some model years outperforming the Chevy Silverado and others lagging behind\n\n\nRam 1500: Has made significant strides in reliability in recent model years, but historically has had more issues than the Silverado\n\n\nToyota Tundra: Often rated as more reliable, but with a smaller market share and fewer configuration options\n\n\nThe Chevy Silverado\u2019s positioning in the full-size truck market is strong, with a balance of reliability, capability, and value that appeals to many buyers.\nConclusion\n\nOverall, Chevy Silverados can be considered reliable trucks. They offer lower-than-average annual repair costs, less frequent unscheduled repairs, and a lower probability of major issues compared to other large trucks. However, like any vehicle, they\u2019re not without their problems, and certain model years and configurations may be more prone to issues than others. When considering a Chevrolet Silverado, it\u2019s important to:\n\n\nResearch specific model years and engine configurations\n\n\nLook for well-maintained examples with documented service history\n\n\nBe prepared for the maintenance requirements of a large truck\n\n\nConsider extended warranties for added peace of mind, especially for used models\n\n\nUltimately, the reliability of a Chevy Silverado depends largely on how well it\u2019s maintained and how it\u2019s used. With proper care and attention, many Chevrolet Silverado owners find their trucks to be extremely reliable workhorses that serve them well for many years and hundreds of thousands of miles. For potential buyers, the Chevrolet Silverado offers a compelling mix of capability, comfort, and reliability. While it may not top every reliability ranking, its strong performance in key metrics and the positive experiences of many long-term owners make it a solid choice in the large truck market. As with any major purchase, do your homework, consider your specific needs, and if possible, have a trusted mechanic inspect any used truck before buying.\n\nTags\n\nYou may also like\n\nChevy Tahoe Reliability\nChevy Tahoe Reliability\n\nAre Dodge Rams Reliable?\nAre Dodge Rams Reliable?\n{\"email\":\"Email address invalid\",\"url\":\"Website address invalid\",\"required\":\"Required field missing\"}\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2025 Municibid -\u00a0Privacy policy\u00a0-\u00a0Accessibility policy"

It remains what it\u2019s always been: a hardworking, full-size pickup truck ready for work wherever it\u2019s called for, whether at construction sites, warehouses or ranches. It can also tow your boat, trailer, or other such plaything while making for a convenient family hauler. Or it can be all of those things. Whatever its role, you\u2019ll find a range of engines including turbocharged four-cylinder, one of two V-8s, or the efficient Duramax diesel. The Silverado is a true pickup truck, with a fairly rough ride at times. But its larger V-8 is powerful and surprisingly refined. Climb inside and you\u2019ll encounter a cabin that runs the gamut from spartan to spoiling. It lacks the over-the-top lavishness of the Ram 1500 in its upper trims, however. For those who spend most of their time mucking through mud and dirt, there\u2019s the Silverado 1500 ZR2, reviewed separately, and for the petrol-averse, there\u2019s the battery-electric Silverado EV.\nWhere This Vehicle Ranks\n#6 in Best Full-Size Pickup Trucks\n 1 ### Ram 1500 STARTING AT: $42,270 2 ### Ford F-150 STARTING AT: $39,245 3 ### Ford F-150 Raptor STARTING AT: $80,800 4 ### Ram 1500 RHO STARTING AT: $71,990 5 ### GMC Sierra 1500 STARTING AT: $38,945 6 ### Chevrolet Silverado 1500 STARTING AT: $37,645\nWhat's New for 2025?\nThe 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 receives two new paint colors: Cypress Gray and Riptide Blue Metallic \u2013 while Work Trucks get a new Universal Vehicle Module for use by public safety agencies. The 2025 model returns in Work Truck, Custom, LT, RST, Custom Trail Boss, LTZ, LT Trail Boss, and High Country trim with a choice of rear- or four-wheel drive on all models except the Trail Boss, which is exclusively four-wheel drive.\nPricing and Which One to Buy\nThe price of the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 starts at $37,645 and goes up to $64,695 depending on the trim and options.\nbuild & price\nWhile the base-level Work Truck and Custom trims are well-suited for tradespeople and folks on a tighter budget, the LT model is where the fancier interior comes into play; we think it's the one to get. We'd also configure our Silverado with the crew cab and standard-length bed for maximum cargo and passenger space. We'd choose the 5.3-liter V-8 over the optional diesel engine because it's cheaper and quicker. Unlike the standard turbo-four, the V-8 also lets us select the Z71 Off-Road package with a host of upgraded hardware that makes playing in the dirt and mud easier and more fun.\nEngine, Transmission, and Performance\nA range of engines\u2014including a turbocharged four-cylinder, to a pair of V-8s, and a Duramax diesel 3.0-liter inline-six\u2014means there's a Silverado 1500 powertrain for any job or adventure. The 6.2-liter V-8 makes 420 horsepower while the smaller 5.3-liter makes 355 horsepower. The turbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder makes 310 horsepower, and the diesel makes 277. Every version of the Silverado we've driven felt smaller than its size suggests. The truck's handling is surprisingly agile, and the brake pedal provides firm and reassuring feedback. Those looking for a more rugged half-ton Silverado will appreciate the Trail Boss model. It features a 2.0-inch lift, gnarly tires, and other upgrades that make taking the path less traveled easier and more entertaining. The ZR2 is the most serious off-roader, and we review it separately.\n0-60-MPH Times\nWith the larger 6.2-liter V-8, the Silverado High Country we tested hit 60 mph in just 5.4 seconds. For comparison, the smaller 355-hp 5.3-liter needed 6.1 seconds. The diesel-powered Silverado we tested had the slowest acceleration of the bunch, but we were impressed by the engine's smooth and quiet operation.\nView Photos\nChevrolet\nMore on the Silverado 1500 Pickup\n\nTested: 2021 Silverado RST 6.2 Is All Engine\nComparing the Silverado EV with Its Gas Sibling\nSilverado PPV Can Pursue Crooks On- And Off-Road\n\nTowing and Payload Capacity\nWith a max towing capacity of 13,300 pounds, the half-ton Silverado is a seriously capable hauler. It beats the Ram 1500's max-tow rating by 550 pounds but trails the F-150's by 700. Chevy's top tow rating is accessible with the 6.2-liter V-8, but the 5.3-liter version can still handle as much as 11,500 pounds. Models with the turbocharged four-cylinder can tow up to 9,500 pounds. The Chevy pickup's powertrains matter less when it comes to payload, which ranges from 1,870 to 2,280 pounds.\nFuel Economy and Real-World MPG\nDon't expect the Silverado 1500 to save you money at the fuel pump, but some of its various powertrain options are more efficient than others. The optional diesel is the most economical, with EPA estimates of up to 23 mpg city and 33 mpg. With four-wheel drive, its highway rating drops down to 26 mpg, which we matched on our 75-mph fuel-economy route. Meanwhile, the gas-fed turbo-four with four-wheel drive is rated at up to 20 mpg city and 22 highway. The thriftiest 5.3-liter V-8, four-wheel-drive powertrain is rated up to 16 mpg in the city and 22 mpg on the highway; our real-world testing revealed that it was actually more efficient than the Silverado's smallest engine, the turbocharged four-cylinder: in our testing the V-8 achieved 21 mpg whereas the turbo-four returned 18 mpg. The 6.2-liter V-8 has city/highway estimates of up to 16/21 mpg, and on our real-world highway test it also proved impressively easy on fuel compared with the turbo-four by delivering 19 mpg. For more information about the Silverado's fuel economy, visit the EPA's website.\nInterior, Comfort, and Cargo\nFrom the stripped-down Work Truck model to the decked-out High Country, the Silverado can be configured in a multitude of ways. Base models offer nothing but the essentials, including manually adjustable front seats, manual locks and windows, and vinyl seats. However, starting on the LT trim, the cabin is significantly snazzier thanks to a more handsome dashboard design with a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster and a huge center touchscreen. The High Country's interior looks particularly pretty with its leather upholstery and open-pore wood trim. While the crew cab has an enormous rear seat with generous headroom, we found the cushions back there to be uncomfortable. Still, this is a practical hauler, featuring clever storage cubbies spread throughout the cabin. While the Chevy lacks the carbon-fiber-reinforced cargo bed that's offered on the half-ton Sierra, it\u2019s now available with a similar multifunction tailgate, dubbed Multi-Flex. Plus, the Chevy's range of different bed lengths will undoubtedly satisfy traditionalists.\nView Photos\nChevrolet\nThe Car and Driver Difference\n\nOur Comprehensive Car Testing Explained\nWhy We Test: Every Number Tells a Story\n\nInfotainment and Connectivity\nEvery Silverado 1500 is equipped with a touchscreen infotainment system that supports Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and a mobile hotspot. The physical knobs and buttons make interacting with the system painless, and we appreciated the screen's prompt responses to our touch inputs. The LT trim and up has a horizontal 13.4-inch touchscreen with enhanced features such as a Google-powered voice assistant, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and available Amazon Alexa integration.\nHow to Buy and Maintain a Car\n\nHow to Buy or Lease a New Car\nHow to Buy a Used Car\nHow to Repair, Maintain, and Care for Your Car\n\nSafety and Driver-Assistance Features\nOverall Safety Rating (NHTSA)\n\nView Crash Test Results\nEvery Silverado comes with an impressive list of standard driver-assistance technology, and it can be fitted with a host of towing assists that make pulling and hooking up a trailer easier. The top-tier High Country can even be equipped with Super Cruise, GM's hands-free-driving technology that Chevy says even works while pulling a trailer. For more information about the Silverado's crash-test results, visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) websites. Key safety features include:\n\nStandard forward-collision warning and automated emergency braking\nStandard blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert\nStandard lane-departure warning and lane-keeping assist\n\nWarranty and Maintenance Coverage\nChevy covers the half-ton Silverado with a competitive warranty that includes one complimentary scheduled maintenance visit. That\u2019s not as good as the Toyota Tundra, which one-ups Chevy with two years or 25,000 miles of complimentary maintenance.

The average annual repair cost is $714 which means it has average ownership costs. While repairs tend to be more severe than average, the number of those issues is low, so major repairs are uncommon for the Silverado 1500.\nCompare With Another Vehicle\nCost\nThe average total annual cost for repairs and maintenance on a Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is $714, compared to an average of $936 for fullsize trucks and $652 for all vehicle models.\nLearn more about cost\n\u00d7\nCost\nThe average total annual cost for unscheduled repairs and maintenance across all model years of a vehicle. Higher average cost alone does not necessarily mean a vehicle is less reliable. For example, parts and labor for your vehicle may be expensive, especially if it is a European luxury car, but if severe issues and annual average visits to the shop are low, that's a good indicator of a reliable car.\nFrequency\nThe average number of times the vehicle is brought into the shop for unscheduled repairs and maintenance in a single year. This metric is calculated by tracking millions of unique vehicles over multiple years to determine an average number of visits per year for each make and model. Controls were included to omit small routine visits to shops such as for oil changes.\nSeverity\nThe severity component to reliability measures the probability that a repair will be a major issue. An issue is considered severe if a repair costs three-times the average annual repair cost for all models, an amount deemed prohibitively expensive given the unscheduled nature of the repair.

I don\u2019t plan to off road it but it feels really smooth. The suspension it\u2019s not too hard but still a little bumpy like most off road trucks. I tried the regular LT with a V8 and this one feels better, drives better and it\u2019s fun.\nThe interior is all plastic, it kinda reminds me of some of the Jeeps, the screen its small but of good quality and not Buggy. Not a Luxury thing in the interior but the driver seat with multiple configuration but without memory positions which sucks.\nIt came with Halogen lights in the from wich are really warm looking for my taste, that\u2019s the first upgrade I\u2019m going to make. Reverse lights are really weak too and it\u2019s hard to see at night when going in reverse, it has a bottom in the driver seat that turns on the hitch light and helps a little bit but not enough.\nSo far that\u2019s the good and the bad a couple of days after getting it.\nI don't regret it at all, and i would get it again.\nRead more\n \n\nNew to Reddit?Create your account and connect with a world of communities.\nContinue with Email\nContinue With Phone Number\nBy continuing, you agree to our User Agreement and acknowledge that you understand the Privacy Policy.\nTop 3% Rank by size\nPublic\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\nTop Posts\n\n\n\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of March 13, 2024 * * *\n\n\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of March 2024 * * *\n\n\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of 2024 * * *\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nTOPICS\n\n\nInternet Culture (Viral)\n\n\nAmazing Animals & Pets Cringe & Facepalm Funny Interesting Memes Oddly Satisfying Reddit Meta Wholesome & Heartwarming\n\n\nGames\n\n\nAction Games Adventure Games Esports Gaming Consoles & Gear Gaming News & Discussion Mobile Games Other Games Role-Playing Games Simulation Games Sports & Racing Games Strategy Games*   Tabletop Games\n\n\nQ&As\n\n\nQ&As*   Stories & Confessions\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n3D Printing Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Computers & Hardware Consumer Electronics DIY Electronics Programming Software & Apps Streaming Services Tech News & Discussion*   Virtual & Augmented Reality\n\n\nPop Culture\n\n\nCelebrities Creators & Influencers Generations & Nostalgia Podcasts Streamers*   Tarot & Astrology\n\n\nMovies & TV\n\n\nAction Movies & Series Animated Movies & Series Comedy Movies & Series Crime, Mystery, & Thriller Movies & Series Documentary Movies & Series Drama Movies & Series Fantasy Movies & Series Horror Movies & Series Movie News & Discussion Reality TV Romance Movies & Series Sci-Fi Movies & Series Superhero Movies & Series*   TV News & Discussion\n\n\n\n\n\nRESOURCES\n\n\nAbout Reddit Advertise Help Blog Careers*   Press\n\n\n\n\nCommunities Best of Reddit Topics\n\n\n\nReddit Rules Privacy Policy User Agreement\n\nReddit, Inc. \u00a9 2025.

The upside of easygoing steering is that the Chevy feels nimble. The downside is that there\u2019s not a ton of feedback. The brakes are strong and easy to modulate, and the ride quality is generally comfortable. Chevy offers the Silverado with four engine options: a 310-horsepower turbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder, a 305-horsepower turbodiesel and a 355- or 420-horsepower V8. The base turbo-four has sufficient muscle for most needs, and the eight-speed automatic transmission operates smoothly in the background. The diesel is impressively refined and quiet, while both V8s deliver muscular acceleration.\nMaximum towing capacity is 13,300 pounds, which is very good for a half-ton pickup. You get that from a Crew Cab with the short box and diesel engine or from a diesel Double Cab (which only comes with the medium box). In general, rear-wheel-drive versions of the truck can tow a couple hundred pounds more, and to get the highest-rated capacity from any model, you\u2019ll need to add the Max Trailering package. Without it, you\u2019re limited to less than 10,000 pounds, regardless of powertrain or body configuration.\nModels with the 2.7-liter turbo-four can tow between 8,900 and 9,500 pounds. You can bump that slightly by going with the 5.3-liter V8, which is rated at between 9,200 and (when properly equipped) 11,300 pounds. With the 6.2-liter V8 and four-wheel drive, the Silverado can tow between 8,800 and 9,200 pounds and up to 13,200 with the Max Trailering package. Rear-wheel drive isn\u2019t an option with the 6.2-liter engine.\nRead more about performance \u00bb\nFuel Economy 9.1/10\nThe 2025 Silverado gets its best fuel economy with the available turbodiesel engine, rated at up to an EPA-estimated 23 mpg in the city and 29 mpg on the highway. Models with the standard turbo-four get up to an estimated 18/21 mpg city/highway, and with the 5.3-liter V8 you\u2019ll see up to 16/21 mpg, according to the EPA. All of these estimates are for engines paired with rear-wheel drive; models with all-wheel drive lose a few mpg. Silverados with the 6.2-liter V8 come only with AWD and are rated at up to 15/20 mpg.\nThere\u2019s also the all-electric Chevrolet Silverado EV which we review separately.\nThinking of leasing a Chevrolet Silverado 1500?\nThe U.S. News Best Price Program saves users an average of $3,009 off the MSRP, and a lower price equals lower monthly lease payments. That means you could see a savings of $83 a month on a 36-month lease.\nZIP Code\nFind Best Price\nAdvertisement\nInterior 7.6/10\nLike many pickups, the Silverado\u2019s work-oriented lower trims are rather plain, with hard interior finishes and little color or pop. Other trims feel more modern and have sporty or upscale design elements, but they still don\u2019t quite match the truck\u2019s higher-end price points or the tier of appointments you\u2019ll see from some of the competition.\nThe standard Regular Cab seats three people across one row. Double Cab and Crew Cab models hold up to six, and you can stick with the front bench seat or opt for two bucket seats. Up front, comfort, support and visibility are good, but the rear seats are a little stiff and force passengers to sit pretty upright. The Double Cab\u2019s rear legroom is fine, but taller people will want to limit their time back there. The back seats of the Crew Cab are expansive, but they\u2019re still not tops in the class for legroom.\nChevy offers three bed sizes: 8 feet (long bed), 6 feet, 6 inches (standard bed) and 5 feet, 8 inches (short bed). The long bed only comes with the Regular Cab, the short bed only comes with the Crew Cab, and the standard bed is available with all three cabs. Maximum payload capacity is 2,260 pounds, from a Regular Cab model with rear-wheel drive and the base turbo-four engine. Most configurations of the truck have a maximum payload of about 1,900 to 2,100 pounds. Standard and available conveniences include a power tailgate, the Multi-Flex tailgate, a bed-view camera, in-bed LED lighting and a spray-on bedliner.\nRead more about interior \u00bb\n All Interior Photos \u00bb\nValue 9.5/10\nThe 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 has an excellent value rating for the full-size pickup truck segment. We determine value based on the vehicle's estimated total cost of ownership, along with the vehicle's MSRP for its base and top trims.\nAdvertisement\nSafety 7.7/10\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the 2025 Silverado 1500 a five-star overall safety rating. This Chevy\u2019s current generation has received mixed crash-test results from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Overall, the Silverado offers a decent list of standard driver-assistance features, including forward automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection and lane-keep assist. There is also a smattering of options, such as adaptive cruise control, a surround-view camera system and reverse pedestrian detection.\nTo install child safety seats, there are two complete sets of LATCH connectors for the rear outboard seats and a tether anchor for the rear middle seat. The tether anchors can be hard to find and confused with other hardware, and the lower anchors are set too deep in the seats.\nQuality and Reliability 84.0/100\nThe 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 has a predicted reliability score of 80 out of 100. A J.D. Power predicted reliability score of 91-100 is considered the Best, 81-90 is Great, 70-80 is Average and 0-69 is Fair and considered below average.\nCritics\u2019 Rating 8.3/10\nThe 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 receives a critics' rating that is average for the class. This rating, which is driven by our qualitative research, represents the overall tone and recommendation level that the automotive press places on a car.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nPricing\nHow Much Is a 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500?\nThe 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 starts at $37,000, which is low for a full-size pickup truck. The standard WT trim comes with a basic touch screen, wireless smartphone integration and a handful of active safety features, such as forward automatic emergency braking and lane-keep assist. The $43,600 Silverado 1500 Custom adds some towing equipment and remote start, while the $48,100 Silverado LT features a 13.4-inch touch screen, heated front seats and more. There are Trail Boss versions of the Custom ($51,800) and LT ($58,800) that have lifted suspensions and mud-rated tires. For $57,700, the Silverado 1500 LTZ comes with ventilated front seats and a slew of additional driver-assistance features. The $62,700 Silverado 1500 High Country adds amenities like leather upholstery and adaptive cruise control. Finally, the Silverado ZR2 starts at $70,000 and sports lots of off-road-ready equipment.\nWhich Is the Best Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Model to Buy?\nThough it carries a decent price hike over the base model, we like the LT for its cool infotainment system and fully digital instrument cluster. This trim also includes upgrades such as dual-zone automatic climate control and rear USB ports, and it\u2019s available with a package that adds key safety features, such as reverse pedestrian detection, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, a surround-view camera system and front and rear parking sensors.\nPricing by Model\n| \nTrim\n| \nPrice\n|\n| --- | --- |\n| Work Truck | $37,000 - $46,300\n|\n| Custom | $43,600 - $49,600\n|\n| LT | $48,100 - $54,100\n|\n| RST | $51,500 - $55,100\n|\n| Custom Trail Boss | $51,800 - $52,100\n|\n| LTZ | $57,700 - $61,300\n|\n| LT Trail Boss | $58,800 - $59,100\n|\n| High Country | $62,700 - $66,500\n|\n| ZR2 | $70,000\n|\nCheck out our U.S. News Best Price Program for great savings at your local Chevrolet dealer.

He contributes vehicle testing reviews to US News & World Report.\nChevrolet needs the Silverado 1500 to continue on an upward trajectory of trying to dethrone the Ford F-150 and its decades-long run as America\u2019s favorite pickup truck. Doing so requires offering the Silverado in an expanding slate of trims and powertrain options, which run the gamut from the bare-bones WT (or Work Truck) to the top-spec ZR2 Bison as a hardcore off-roader. I gravitate toward the ZR2\u2019s trail-tuned goodies, but even the most affordable Silverado on the market needs to prioritize capability, interior space, tech and connectivity. If you\u2019ve been stuck with a Ford or Ram for years, I recommend checking out the latest Silverado generation\u2019s blend of luxury and rugged utilitarianism. If the design doesn\u2019t do the trick, the choice of three engine options should cover the bases for just about any shopper: from a budget-friendly inline-four to a beefy V8 and a Duramax turbodiesel that offers power, torque and efficiency. Buyers are spoiled for choice in today\u2019s pickup truck market, and each Silverado offers a unique combination of attributes for just about every demographic.\nWhat We Like\nThe Silverado\u2019s blend of functional design and purposeful engineering makes every truck in the lineup worth considering. The WT strips to the basics, while the LT steps up as more of a daily driver. The available Z71 option package adds a bit of off-road capability, while the ZR2 off-roaders go all-out on skid plates, knobby tires, suspension travel and locking differentials. For me, the new 3.0-liter Duramax turbodiesel engine is the best choice. A 420-horsepower V8 might sound a bit better, but the diesel makes 495 pound-feet of torque to allow for legitimate acceleration and serious towing capability. Part of that owes to the 10-speed automatic transmission (which Chevy developed in partnership with Ford) to help keep each engine right in its powerband. Inside, wireless Apple CarPlay comes standard. On trims other than the ZR2, GM\u2019s industry-leading Super Cruise semi-automated driving system is available to make long road trips a breeze.\nWhat We Don\u2019t Like\nInflation has hit the truck market hard, and not just in terms of pricing. Every generation of pickup seems to get bigger and bigger, especially the more hardcore off-roading packages. A fully equipped Silverado 1500 ZR2 Bison, for example, weighs just shy of 6,000 pounds. More importantly, the huge square hood and boxy cabin reinforce the visual impression of size from behind the wheel \u2014 something that I struggled with in town and while off-roading. The Silverado\u2019s rear leaf springs, rather than coil springs on a Ford or Ram, also create a bit more suspension chop (which only the ZR2\u2019s high-tech Multimatic shock dampers can truly control). While towing a lightweight trailer with the Duramax diesel, I also needed to fill up on DEF (diesel exhaust fluid) after just a few hundred miles, which may add to the monthly fuel budget by a fair amount. You may also balk at the price tags for higher Silverado trims, which can approach six figures when fully optioned.\nHow It Drove\nFor a full-size pickup truck, the Silverado surprised me with relatively tame driving manners. An independent front suspension and thick sway bars prevent too much body roll, and every engine option pairs well with the 10-speed automatic transmission. The turbo-four does OK for its size, but stepping up to the grumble of a V8 or the torque of a Duramax diesel always brings a smile to my face. For buyers who care about fuel economy, the turbodiesel again deserves a second look: I spent 10 days on a road trip testing fuel economy with a ZR2 diesel and logged an average of 21.3 mpg at an average speed of 68.3 mph. That\u2019s despite the 33-inch off-road tires and an upright aerodynamic profile. A Chevy engineer told me that a two-wheel-drive WT equipped with the diesel can hit 30 mpg with more conscientious driving. Of course, buyers need to pick the right Silverado to fit their lifestyle, and even if a diesel doesn\u2019t sound ideal, it\u2019s hard to go wrong with any trim level in the lineup.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nIs the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 a Good Truck?\nYes, the 2025 Silverado 1500 is a very good full-size pickup. Its intriguing engine options range from an efficient diesel to muscular V8s, while its workhorse credentials include maximum towing and payload capacities above 13,000 and 2,200 pounds, respectively. Well-balanced ride and handling characteristics make the truck easy to live with, and as long as you\u2019re willing to spend more to outfit your Silverado 1500 above lower trim levels, you\u2019ll enjoy a handsome interior with plenty of modern tech.\nThough it has an attractive base MSRP for the class, the Silverado is still a step behind some segment leaders. The Ram 1500 has a luxury-grade ride and interior, while the Ford F-150 leads the pack in towing and hauling. There\u2019s also the all-electric Silverado EV, which is reviewed separately.\nAdvertisement\n2024 vs. 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500: What's the Difference?\nChevrolet only makes minor changes to the Silverado for 2025. The ZR2 trim gains standard parking sensors and a premium stereo, cruise control is standard in the base Work Truck trim, and a trailer brake controller is newly standard in the LT and above trims.\nCompare the 2024 and 2025 Silverado 1500 \u00bb\nHere are the key changes for the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 over the last few years:\n\n2025: more standard features for some trims\n2024: wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay joined standard features list; turbodiesel engine became available in ZR2 trim\n2023: ZR2 Bison model debuted; diesel engine gained 28 horsepower and 35 pound-feet of torque\n2022: refreshed interior and exterior design; off-road-oriented ZR2 trim introduced; a 13.4-inch touch screen and Super Cruise partially automated driving system became available; several active safety features became standard; maximum towing capacity increased to 13,300 pounds\n2021: increased towing capacity for four-cylinder and diesel models; wireless smartphone integration and Multi-Flex Tailgate became available\n\nIf you're considering an older model, be sure to read our 2022 Silverado 1500, 2023 Silverado 1500 and 2024 Silverado 1500 reviews to help make your decision.

It has a long list of standard active safety aids, multiple options for a user-friendly touch screen and a trio of powerful and efficient six-cylinder engines. It\u2019s one of the best choices in the class for an everyday or family vehicle where work duty is a second concern. The Silverado\u2019s maximum towing capacity is about 1,750 pounds more than the Ram, and the Ram\u2019s longest bed is 6 feet, 4 inches, compared to the Silverado\u2019s 8-foot option.\nCompare the Silverado 1500 and Ram 1500 \u00bb\nChevrolet Silverado 1500 vs. Ford F-150\nThe Ford F-150 is another top pick in this segment, besting all its rivals with up to 13,500 pounds of towing and almost 2,500 pounds of payload capacity. A half-dozen engine options, several off-road-oriented models and the high-performance Raptor models make this truck one of the most versatile out there. It comes well-equipped with a standard 12-inch touch screen, lots of driver-assistance tech and a long list of optional features that can make towing or using the bed easier. Anyone who\u2019s even a little undecided on their full-size truck choice would do well to consider an F-150.\nCompare the Silverado 1500 and F-150 \u00bb\nCompare the Silverado 1500, Ram 1500 and F-150 \u00bb\nAdvertisement\n2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Models and Trims\nThe 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 comes in eight trims: WT, Custom, LT, RST, Trail Boss, LTZ, High Country and ZR2.

There's also an all-electric Silverado EV, which is reviewed separately. The Silverado 1500 is offered in a variety of trim levels and engine choices to appeal to any truck buyer and budget, from a basic work vehicle to off-road-capable models and a luxurious top-of-the-line trim. This class of trucks is extremely competitive, so be sure to check out our Expert Rating to confirm how the Silverado 1500 stacks up against the competition.\nCost to DriveCost to drive estimates for the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Work Truck 2dr Regular Cab SB (2.7L 4cyl Turbo 8A) and comparison vehicles are based on 15,000 miles per year (with a mix of 55% city and 45% highway driving) and energy estimates of $4.85 per gallon for regular unleaded in California.\nMonthly estimates based on costs in California\n$313/mo \u00a0for Silverado 1500 Work Truck\nSilverado 1500 Work Truck\nvs\n$325/mo\nAvg. Large Truck\nCalculate my fuel costs\nEdmunds spotlight: Smart use of technology\nThe Silverado 1500 gets a shoutout for its use of technology. The infotainment system is available with a large 13.4-inch touchscreen and benefits from easy-to-read graphics and quick responses to user inputs. On LT and higher trim levels, drivers can leverage the truck's Google-based voice recognition system to make infotainment interactions easier and less distracting. Features such as trailer tire pressure sensors and auxiliary rearview cameras make towing safer and reduce stress, while GM's Super Cruise allows for hands-free highway driving. The Ford F-150 is the only other truck with this level of driving automation.\nCompetitors to consider\nThere's a four-way tug-of-war at the top of the full-size pickup class. The Ford F-150 leads in sales and in Edmunds' rankings thanks to its hefty 13,500-pound tow capacity and clever features that include an onboard generator. The Silverado 1500 comes close with its tow rating of up to 13,300 pounds, and they both beat the 2025 Ram 1500, with its max of 11,550 pounds. Even so, we rate the Ram higher for its smoother ride quality and refined interior. The Toyota Tundra has a similar suspension design with corresponding ride-quality advantages, and it's also available with a hybrid powertrain.\nEdmunds Expert Rating\nOur VerdictThe Edmunds Vehicle Testing Team evaluates a fresh batch of vehicles every week, pairing objective assessments at our test track with real-world driving on city streets, freeways and winding roads. The data we gather results in our Expert Ratings. They\u2019re based on 30-plus scores that cover every aspect of the automotive experience.\nAverage\n7.5\nout of 10\nedmunds TESTED\nThe 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 stays true to its old-school roots, and the latest updates to the interior and technology do a lot to help this truck be more competitive against its full-size rivals. But lackluster comfort and value keep it from being a top pick.\nRated for you by America's best test team.\nPerformance\n7.5/10\nHow does the Silverado 1500 drive? We tested a Silverado crew cab in the High Country trim with the 5.3-liter V8 and four-wheel drive. Acceleration and braking are sufficient for daily driving or towing. Our test truck covered 60 mph in about 7 seconds from a standstill at our test track. An equivalent F-150 is a little quicker, but there's nothing wrong with the Silverado's power. Around town, the transmission shifts smoothly and makes the most of the engine's low-end torque.  \nThe truck tracks straight on the highway, but the steering effort is a bit too light. Handling is secure, and body roll is effectively held in check as you navigate turns. But midcorner bumps can upset the Silverado pretty easily. Going off-road? A regular 4WD Silverado will suffice, but consider getting the Z71 off-road option package or the Trail Boss trim level to enhance its potential.\nRead more\nComfort\n7/10\nHow comfortable is the Silverado 1500? The Silverado's seating isn't quite as plush as the seats in the F-150 or Ram 1500, yet there's enough padding and support to keep you comfortable on long drives. The ride is relatively smooth on the highway, and the truck ably absorbs most small impacts. But it can get bouncy when you drive on roads that have a high frequency of bumps and dips.  \nThe climate system easily heats and cools the cabin, though operating it can be a little tricky because a lot of the control buttons are small. We really like the optional ventilated and split-heated front seats (separate settings for the seatback and seat cushion), a GM-exclusive feature. Engine noise is effectively muted until you get aggressive with the throttle, at which point it gets a bit unpleasant.\nRead more\nInterior\n7.5/10\nHow\u2019s the interior? Chevrolet finally provided the sorely needed interior upgrade Silverado owners have wanted for years. The latest cabin design looks and feels far more modern than the one used for the 2019-2021 trucks, with sporty elements on the ZR2 trim and upscale materials on top-tier trims like the High Country. Importantly, most of the controls are easy to use, a staple of the previous model, with large clear buttons and a swift touchscreen.  \nInside, the Silverado has plenty of space for adults in its crew-cab configuration. This is particularly evident in the back seat, which has massive legroom to offer. Some models sit high off the ground, but large door openings and proper seat positioning make overall accessibility a positive experience.\nRead more\nContinue reading Edmunds Expert Rating below\nSave as much as $7,059\u00a0with Edmunds Click on the trim you\u2019re interested in to see what Edmunds suggests you should pay to get a good deal.

Technology is a strong point in the Silverado. An available 13.4-inch touchscreen offers a wide range of capability without confusing the user, and the hi-res screen responds quickly to clicks and swipes. There are also clear maps, and navigation finds addresses and points of interest quickly. Plus, the Google-powered voice recognition system understands natural language and reads your command back to you on the screen. With your voice, you can change the station, adjust the climate control and more.  \nOur test truck came with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, both with wireless connectivity. CarPlay looked great on the massive screen. There's a dedicated storage space for your smartphone, and some models include a wireless charger. Driver aids are abundant, with several available exterior cameras that help when parking this behemoth of a truck. The rear cross-traffic warning system and its helpful buzzes in the seat bottom are effective too.  \nAdaptive cruise control generally works well, particularly for such a large vehicle. However, we did experience one instance with our test truck where it unexpectedly lurched forward with the system on in stop-and-go traffic; our driver had to quickly apply the brakes to override it. This put a stain on an otherwise positive experience. GM's hands-free driver assist technology, Super Cruise, is available but only on the top-trim High Country \u2014 Ford offers its similar BlueCruise system on several F-150 trims.\nRead more\nTowing and Storage\n8/10\nHow are the towing and storage? We tested a 5.3-liter V8-powered, short-bed 4WD crew-cab truck that had the standard 3.23 axle gearing. This configuration provided plenty of towing and hauling capability for our needs. As for the bed itself, it's a bit longer, deeper and wider than its rivals, and it has more tie-downs.  \nThe Silverado's boxy center console contains multiple pockets, but we've found the F-150's and Ram 1500's center consoles to be a little more versatile for storing items. For family duty, the crew cab's back seat has two sets of lower car seat anchors and three top tethers, so child safety seats will fit in any of the three positions. But loading the seats, not to mention the kiddos, might be difficult due to the truck's ride height.\nRead more\nContinue reading Edmunds Expert Rating below\nFuel Economy\n7.5/10\nHow\u2019s the fuel economy? The Silverado High Country we tested had the 5.3-liter V8 and 4WD, which earns an EPA-estimated 17 mpg in combined city/highway driving. We found that number to be reasonably achievable in the real world. The best fuel economy for the Silverado comes from the available diesel-fueled six-cylinder.\nValue\n6.5/10\nIs the Silverado 1500 a good value? The Silverado isn't outrageously expensive, but it is priced higher than its key rivals without offering any advantages in features, style or interior quality. The buttons and dashboard plastics are similar to those in the previous-gen truck: sturdy but somewhat cheap-looking. Chevy's warranty coverage is average, though you do get the first scheduled maintenance for free.\nRead more\nWildcard\n7/10\nFull-size trucks such as the Silverado aren't necessarily fun to drive. But with its commanding view of the road, lots of towing power, and brutish front-end styling, the Silverado can put a smile on your face. However, the interior looks dated and borrows many pieces and design cues from the previous generation. It may or may not be the full-size truck personality you want.\nRead more\nWhich Silverado 1500 does Edmunds recommend?\nWith nine distinct models and four engines to choose from, the Silverado 1500 gives shoppers plenty of options to suit their particular needs. For many, the midrange LT will be a good fit, offering a much nicer interior than the basic Work Truck while forgoing all-terrain features and luxury items that may not be needed.\nCompare 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 trim levels\nHelpful trims summary and side-by-side comparison chart\nChevrolet Silverado 1500 models\nThe 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is a full-size pickup available in nine trim levels: Work Truck (WT), Custom, Custom Trail Boss, LT, RST, LT Trail Boss, ZR2, LTZ and High Country. Like most full-size trucks, the Silverado is offered in varying cab and bed configurations, including a two-door regular cab, a four-door extended cab (Double Cab), and a four-door crew cab with full-size rear doors and generous rear seat room. Depending on cab selection, the three available bed sizes are an 8-foot-long bed, a 6.5-foot bed and a shorter 5-foot-8-inch bed.

SB (2.7L 4cyl Turbo 8A)\nJust bought a Silverado Custom with 2.7 Turbomax 4 cycl. With 594 miles on it, it starts shaking and shimmying at a light. Hit the gas and the engine is shaking like crazy. Take it back to dealer and 2 cylinders needed to be replaced! Heritage Chevrolet in Owings Mills, MD would not switch out the truck for a new one. I am beyond vexed because that truck will never be the same. I\u00a0\u2026 can care less about a warranty. How about do right by your customers and take back a defective product and fight it out with GM for sending you a bad truck!

I am so pleased with this truck. I might not accelerate as fast as the 6.2 gas motor, but nobody needs to accelerate like that in the first place. Especially 1 pollen trailers. This is a very smooth truck and I am averaging above 18 mpg with\u00a0\u2026 consistent runs with my dump trailer.\nRead more\nRead less\nOver All good\n5 out of 5 stars\nRuss427, 03/06/2024\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LTZ 4dr Crew Cab 4WD 6.6 ft. SB (5.3L 8cyl 10A)\nIt's almost everything I wanted. But no moon roof or sliding back glass. Major flaw is the auto shut off when stopping. Have to shut that off every time I get in the truck. Also don't like the timer shut off when outside the truck. Not safe for people who are waiting inside the truck in hot/cold weather. No way to override it.\nTruck for work or pleasure\n5 out of 5 stars\nValor Trooper , 09/24/2024\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LTZ 4dr Crew Cab 5.8 ft. SB (5.3L 8cyl 10A)\nI traded a 2020 Chevy Silverado LTZ crew cab, leather seats, black exterior color, short bed, 4x4 with Z71 options, 8 speed transmission, and 5.3 v8 for a 2024 Chevy Silverado LTZ crew cab, leather seats, metallic silver color, short bed, 4x4 minus the Z71 options, 10 speed transmission, and 5.3 v8. The 2024 Chevy Silverado has options( automatic steps, multi purpose tailgate, heads up\u00a0\u2026 display, 22 inch tires w/chrome wheels, power sun roof, power rear center window, and sprayed bed liner) some of which were not part of the 2020 Chevy Silverado. The 2024 Chevy minus the Z71 option with 22 inch wheels and road style tires rides a bit smoother than my 2020 Chevy. I still maintain the 4x4 capability when needed especially with the Illinois winters and some mild off road traveling. The shift/gear selector is now located on the center console rather than the steering column which provides no inconvenience for either use or position placement. At my senior age of 81 and before I have always enjoyed my trucks and have had quite a few including Chevy, GMC, Ford, & Toyota trucks. The 2024 Silverado LTZ continues to be a pricey purchase as truck prices across the brand spectrum are all pricey purchases. I am pleased with my 2024 Silverado with regard to performance and design. This is my first metallic silver exterior color which looks great and reflects the sun heat better than my previous black exterior colored trucks. If price is not a limiting factor, I believe you would enjoy owning and driving a full size 1500, Silverado LTZ.\nRead more\nRead less\nWe have a limited number of reviews for the 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500, so we've included reviews for other years of the Silverado 1500 since its last redesign.\nSee all 38 reviews of the Chevrolet Silverado 1500\nWrite a vehicle review\nHelpful shopping links\n\n\nSee All for Sale\n\n\nBuild & Price\n\n\nDeals & Incentives\n\n\nLease Offers\n\n\nPrice Checker\u2122\n\n\nShop Used\n\n\n2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 video\nFord F-150 Tremor vs. Ram 1500 Rebel vs. Chevy Silverado Trail Boss | Off-Road Comparison Test\nFord F-150 Tremor vs. Ram 1500 Rebel vs. Chevy Silverado Trail Boss | Off-Road Comparison Test\nWe\u2019re putting America\u2019s best-selling trucks \u2014 the Ford F-150, Chevy Silverado and Ram 1500 \u2013 up against one another on the trails.

It's one of the most successful vehicles on sale in terms of sheer units moved, and it's always given the Ford F-150 a run for its money. The Silverado received a major face-lift for 2022 that brought its interior right up to date with rivals from Ford and Ram. There's plenty to pick from in the powertrain department too. Its standard turbocharged four-cylinder engine is no slouch \u2014 it produces more torque than the 5.3-liter V8 and almost as much as the 6.2-liter V8. Chevy also offers a turbodiesel engine for the Silverado, which is significant because both the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500 no longer do. Because of those recent updates, we doubt we'll see any significant changes for 2025.\nEdmunds spotlight: Class-leading interior tech\nWith its 2022 face-lift, Chevy brought the Silverado's interior tech bang up to date. It did better than that \u2014 it built a class leader. Chevy based its new infotainment on Google's software, and the results are a more responsive system, the best voice recognition in the business, and features like Alexa and the Google Play Store to help you control your home from your car and tailor the infotainment experience to exactly what your needs are with Google apps. But don't worry \u2014 it still has Apple CarPlay and Android Auto despite GM's move away from the phone mirroring software in its newer models.\nCompetitors to consider\nThe Silverado's archrival, the Ford F-150, is always an option when you're looking at a Silverado. The Ford offers more tech and a hybrid model that can power off-board accessories and work tools. The Ford also recently got a big face-lift that brings with it more power for base models and updated Raptor models. If you want something that can go off-road fast, the Raptor is the way to go (and a car Chevy has no answer for).\nEdmunds says\nThe Silverado is a solid buy even if the F-150 lineup is more well rounded.\n\nFAQ\nIs the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 a good car?\nThe Edmunds experts tested the 2025 Silverado 1500 both on the road and at the track, giving it a 7.5 out of 10.

Let\u2019s explore the cutting-edge safety features that make this truck a fortress on wheels.  \nAdvanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)\nSuper Cruise Technology\n\nHands-Free Driving: The 2024 Silverado 1500 introduces the revolutionary Super Cruise technology, allowing for hands-free driving on compatible roads. This system uses real-time cameras, sensors, and GPS to ensure that your truck stays in its lane and at a safe distance from other vehicles.\n\nForward Collision Alert and Automatic Emergency Braking\n\nCollision Prevention: The forward collision alert warns you of potential collisions with a vehicle ahead, while the automatic emergency braking can kick in to reduce the severity of an impact or even avoid a collision altogether.\n\nEnhanced Visibility\nHD Surround Vision\n\n360-Degree View: The HD Surround Vision provides a bird\u2019s-eye view of the truck, making it easier to navigate tight spaces and increase awareness of your surroundings.\n\nRear Camera Mirror\n\nRear Visibility: Switch from a traditional rearview mirror to a camera display that provides a wider, less obstructed field of view behind the truck.\n\nSmart Trailering\nAdvanced Trailering System\n\nStress-Free Towing: With features like trailer sway control and hill start assist, the Silverado 1500 makes towing safer and more manageable, even for less experienced drivers.\n\nHitch Guidance with Hitch View\n\nPrecision Hookup: The hitch guidance system offers dynamic backing guidelines to help align your hitch, while the hitch view allows for a zoomed-in view on the infotainment screen for precise positioning.\n\nPassive Safety Features\nHigh-Strength Steel Safety Cage\n\nRobust Protection: The Silverado 1500\u2019s safety cage is constructed with high-strength steel, providing a sturdy shell for passenger protection in the event of a collision.\n\nAirbag System\n\nComprehensive Cushioning: The truck comes equipped with a comprehensive airbag system, including frontal, seat-mounted side-impact, and head-curtain airbags for all rows.\n\nTeen Driver Technology\n\nGuided Driving Experience: This system encourages safe driving habits for new drivers by setting speed alerts, volume limits, and more.

This means that the truck delivers high performance off-road or on the highway. Its interior is masterfully crafted with fine materials like premium leather, and better functionality is available via a multifunctional tailgate. High-level safety is available, but you must select a trim level. Here at our dealership near Lima, Ohio, we carry the:\n\n\nHigh Country\nZR2\nLTZ\nLT Trail Boss\nRST\nLT\nCustom Trail Boss\nCustom\nWT\n\nSafety and Security\nThe 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is no slouch in the safety department. The first advantage is that the truck's frame is made from high-strength material and won't fold under pressure. Its five-star safety rating provides peace of mind while on the go, as you and your loads are fully protected. This includes at least six driver-assistance features. The idea is to prevent a road accident before it occurs, which is made possible by radar-based sensors that detect the area around you near St. Marys, Ohio.\nFront Collision Alert detects if you're approaching another vehicle too quickly from the rear. The brakes are automatically activated if the driver fails to slow down or stop. A following distance indicator prevents you from rear-ending another vehicle by keeping the Silverado 1500 safe from the vehicle in front near Wapakoneta, Ohio.\nRear Cross-Traffic Alert is another beneficial feature for Van Wert, Ohio shoppers, and it comes in handy while you're backing up. The sensors detect movement from pedestrians, vehicles, or animals. The truck's IntelliBeam headlamps automatically engage under poor lighting conditions. In addition to that, there is Lane Keep Assist, Lane Departure Warning, and Blind Spot Monitoring.\nMuch more information is available when you speak with a representative today at our dealership near Delphos.\nCategories: Green, New Inventory\nTags: 2024-Chevrolet-Silverado1500-3LT-ZR2Bison-CrewCab-Truck, Jim Schmidt Chevrolet Buick of Delphos, 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500\n\nRequest More Info\n\nSearch Blog\nSearch Blog \nSearch   \nSubscribe to Our Blog\n\nRSS 2.0\n\nPopular Tags\nnew inventory Jim Schmidt Chevrolet Buick of Delphos Used Chevy new vehicles service center Chevy Equinox Chevy Silverado 1500 Schedule Service routine maintenance New Chevy Bolt EV New Chevy Electric Vehicles Chevy SUVs 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 New Chevy Trucks New Chevy Equinox 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 tips and tricks windshield New Chevy Jim Schmidt Chevrolet Buick of Delphos's Blog Chevrolet Equinox used vehicles auto financing new cars Maintenance Center Near Me Chevy Suv Buick SUV Jumpstart your car Battery find the perfect car\nShare\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\n\nWebsite by Dealer.com AdChoices\n\nContact\nAbout\nPrivacy\nSitemap\n\n\n\n; ;"

While both are formidable trucks, the Silverado 1500 has recently stepped up its game, offering drivers a compelling package of power, performance, technology, and style that surpasses its Ford counterpart.\nDesign and Style: A Strong First Impression\nThe Silverado 1500 boasts a bold, muscular design that commands attention. Its exterior is characterized by sharp lines, a commanding stance, and chrome accents that exude confidence. In contrast, the F-150\u2019s design, while competent, can feel somewhat generic and lacks the visual impact of the Silverado.\nPower and Performance: Outmuscling the Competition\nWhen it comes to power, the Silverado 1500 delivers. Its lineup of engines, including a potent V8 option, offers exceptional performance and towing capacity. Chevrolet\u2019s attention to detail in engineering ensures that the Silverado not only delivers impressive power but also handles with precision and confidence. The F-150, while capable, often feels less refined and responsive compared to the Silverado.\nTechnology and Interior: A Comfortable Command Center\nThe Silverado\u2019s interior is a testament to modern luxury and functionality. With a spacious cabin, high-quality materials, and intuitive technology, it provides a comfortable and enjoyable driving experience. The Silverado\u2019s infotainment system is user-friendly and offers a wide range of features, including wireless charging and advanced connectivity. While the F-150 has made strides in technology, it still lags behind the Silverado in terms of interior refinement and overall user experience.\nSafety and Reliability: Peace of Mind on the Road\nBoth the Silverado and F-150 offer a suite of safety features, but Chevrolet\u2019s commitment to safety is evident in the Silverado\u2019s comprehensive package. Advanced driver-assistance systems and robust construction ensure that you and your passengers are protected. Chevrolet\u2019s reputation for reliability is well-established, giving Silverado owners added peace of mind.\nIn conclusion, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 offers a compelling combination of power, performance, design, technology, and safety that surpasses its Ford F-150 rival. While the F-150 has its merits, the Silverado\u2019s overall package provides a more satisfying ownership experience.\nStop by our dealership at Hendrick Chevrolet Monroe to test drive one of these new trucks yourself!\nPosted in Uncategorized\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

Each brand offers a half-ton champ, and all three tout an exceptional reputation. However, a comparison is all it takes to see that there is one that takes the lead. Just see for yourself how the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 outshines the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500 by taking a closer look at our analysis. You will soon understand why our experts recommend this model to Friendly Chevrolet customers like you around Springfield, Illinois.\u00a0\n\nVIEW SILVERADO 1500 INVENTORY\n\nCHEVROLET SILVERADO 1500 VS. FORD F-150\nChevy Boasts Durability - Both the Chevy Silverado 1500 and Ford F-150 have seen a significant drop in their overall weight due to changes in their design. While Ford adopted aluminum as one of its main structural elements, however, Chevy stuck with tried-and-true steel. Though you may see greater savings through fuel efficiency with the competitor, its architecture is more easily affected by dings and dents as a result. You can therefore expect to pay more at the body shop for repairs, costing you more in the long-run.\nChevy Puts Safety First - As you can imagine, a tough composition is key to keeping drivers and passengers safe. That is why the new Chevy Silverado 1500 did will in crash tests and earned a 5-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Though the Ford truck does fairly well under similar circumstances, there is an observable difference in regard to prevention and response. Our automaker offers a long list of driver-assist technologies like Teen Driver which are exclusive to the brand and plans like OnStar\u00ae automatic crash response to boost your peace of mind.\n\u00a0\nCHEVROLET SILVERADO 1500 VS. RAM 1500\nChevy Packs a Punch - One easy way to see how the Chevy Silverado 1500 and Ram 1500 compare is to put their toughest engines side-by-side. They Chevrolet truck is armed with a 6.8L V8 which supplies a substantial 420 horsepower and 460 pound-feet of torque. Meanwhile, the 5.7L V8 equipped inside the Ram truck supplies only 395 horsepower and 410 pound-feet of torque. With this impressive strength, our model has the potential to tow a maximum of 12,500 pounds which is 1,880 more pounds than its rival.\nChevy Stays Modern - Brawn is no longer enough to satisfy the average truck driver. That is why the new Chevy Silverado 1500 is infused with smarter technologies. Take its Chevrolet MyLink multimedia system as an example. Compatible with Apple and Android devices, optional with a 4G LTE Wi-Fi signal and other features, this center console is a step above the Ram 1500 which still relies on fairly a basic user-interface. Thus, you can look forward to a more productive and enjoyable experience by choosing Chevrolet.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBE THE LEADER OF THE PACK - GET YOUR CHEVY SILVERADO 1500 AT OUR SPRINGFIELD CHEVY DEALERSHIP\nThese advantages only hint at what the new Chevrolet Silverado 1500 can do. So, if you want to get to know this new Chevrolet pickup truck a little more, then head over to our Chevy dealership near Chatham and Taylorville, Illinois.

Before you buy just about anything these days, you probably jump online and look for feedback. Whether it be ratings, reviews, or just plain gripes. There\u2019s a wealth of information at our fingertips regarding just about anything. And whether you\u2019re buying a coffee pot or a Silverado, using the real world experiences of others can save you a big headache down the road.\nWe\u2019re here to tell you that there are a large group of experienced Chevy owners just waiting to share their knowledge with you here at Chevrolet Forum. This thread\u00a0provides a perfect example of that. A new member who goes by\u00a0speedracer2016\u00a0headed to the forums with a simple request. And that was to find out the good, the bad, and the ugly experiences others have had with their Silverado pickups.\n\n\u201cHello all. I am NEW and the reason I joined was because I am thinking of becoming a Silverado owner. What better way to find out about the vehicle (before I buy) than to ask those that own or did own one and their experiences. I am looking at a 2005 1500 Ext Cab 4wd Z71 with the 5.3L motor. So, any areas of major problems?\nIF the truck sells before I get this information, any years and models that I should stay away from? Knowing what you know now would you buy it again or would you buy something else. Bottom line, I am just trying to make sure I have all the facts about this truck before I go and buy it and then find out I should NOT have. ANY and ALL experiences, warnings and hints greatly appreciated. THANKS..\u201d\n\n\nWithout hesitation,\u00a0hicksvilleshick\u00a0chimes in with some useful advice, making some good points about Chevrolet\u2019s simplicity and the availability of parts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a Chevy guy most of my life so I\u2019m sold on them. Parts are cheaper and is engineered in a way that makes sense to me.\nThat being said, manifold gaskets, exhaust studs, transfer cases pump hole, transmissions can be weak if not maintained, and the push buttons for the 4\u00d74 can be flaky. Oh, and abs modules tend to crap out. None are horribly expensive if you do them yourself. The transfer case wear hole being the worst.\nThe g80 differential that almost always comes with the z71 sometimes explodes if abused. My z71-ish didn\u2019t come with the g80, so no locker for me but hopefully no sudden explosion either. I just recently got a 00 and love it. \u00a0The 5.3\u2019s are solid and there are plenty of goodies and running options for them. Aftermarket support for Chevy is world\u2019s ahead of everyone else in my opinion.\u201d\n\n\nLike most vehicles, buying the right combo is better than buying the wrong one and wishing you hadn\u2019t. Which is the premise behind\u00a0tech2\u2018s useful advice.\n\n\u201c4.8 is underpowered, 5.3 is a good motor and it\u2019s before all the afm stuff that started in 2007. T__hey do have 1500 HD models that have the 2500 chassis, suspension, 6.0L engine and 4l80E trans.\u00a0IMO get a 2500 series of that generation 1999-2006 but stay on the later end of the run 05-06 due to age.\u201d\n\n99 3 door\u00a0offers up some proof that proper maintenance will keep you on the road for a long time.\n\n\u201cThe pickup now is well over 234,000 miles and still running great. It handles the 10\u2032 camper very well which I used over this past weekend. I\u2019ve had the 4 wheel drive selector buttons replaced because the original switch shorted out. And had new tires put on it that were heavy duty enough to handle the weight of the camper better than the ones I had on it. It still doesn\u2019t use any oil to speak of and still starts at -20 degrees.\u201d\n\n\nAnd\u00a0Sean Martin\u00a0makes the simple and obvious case of why he prefers Chevys over anything else.\n\n\u201cI have a 2000 5.3l 1500 now. I have had Chevy and Ford trucks all my life I\u2019m 43 now\u2026both make good trucks..Chevys are infinitely\u00a0easier to work on\u2026and cheaper to repair\u2026both hold up well if maintained. My 5.3 gets my 1500 up to speed a lot quicker than the 5.4 Triton in my old F-150 or Expedition. It\u2019s more a matter of taste. But if upgrades are on your future, Chevy has better and cheaper aftermarket support.\u201d\n\nAll of which is valuable information for the prospective Silverado buyer.

Starting in the automotive industry straight out of college, she has evaluated and written about trucks, SUVs, and cars, from both the consumer and enthusiast perspectives, for nearly 25 years. Allyson has previously written for Motor Trend, Truck Trend, and Four Wheeler Magazine.\nPros\nExcellent towing capacity \nMany varied trim levels \nHelpful towing tech  \nCons\nNo available hybrid powertrain  \nWhat's New?\nMore standard and optional features \nNew colors \nNew wheel design  \nThe 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is a great all-around truck for work and play, with a variety of cabs, engines, and specialized trims. Pricing starts at $38,995.\nThe Chevrolet Silverado is the second best-selling vehicle in the country. This excellent all-around truck is ready for everything from family adventures to hard work. Its towing and payload capacities are just shy of the F-150\u2019s best-in-class numbers. And it offers excellent features for towing, plus a terrific off-road-oriented model. The Silverado has the capability, the comfort, and the powertrain options that will satisfy most buyers. \nThe all-electric Chevrolet Silverado EV is reviewed separately, as is the stronger Silverado HD. \nWe\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours driving and evaluating this generation of full-size pickup trucks, including the Chevrolet Silverado. \nWhat's New for 2025\nMore features become standard on different trim levels. Most notably, a trailer brake controller comes standard on LT and higher models. Cruise control is now standard on the Work Truck trim. The ZR2 gains standard premium audio and front and rear park assist. Across the trim line, there are new 20-inch high-gloss black wheels available, as well as two new paint colors. \n2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Pricing\nThe 2025 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Regular Cab has a starting sticker price of $38,995.\nMSRP\nKBB Fair Purchase Price (national avg.)\nSilverado 1500 Regular Cab\n$38,995 - $43,795\n$37,072 - $42,152\nSilverado 1500 Double Cab\n$42,295 - $54,395\n$40,247 - $52,491\nSilverado 1500 Crew Cab\n$44,695 - $71,995\n$43,130 - $52,547\nThe Chevrolet Silverado 1500\u2019s starting price is similar to that of the Ford F-150 and slightly lower than this Chevy\u2019s corporate sibling, the GMC Sierra 1500. That Toyota Tundra, which isn\u2019t available in a regular cab model, begins several thousand dollars higher. The most popular trim level for the Silverado is the LT Crew Cab with the 5.3-liter V8 engine. \nBefore buying a new Silverado 1500 full-size truck, check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to know what you should be paying. The Tundra enjoys the strongest resale values of full-size trucks, while the Silverado 1500 is about average. \nPower, Ride, and Handling\nThe Silverado\u2019s base engine is a 310-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder engine with an incredible 430 lb-ft of torque, more torque than the 5.3-liter V8. While some might be skeptical of a 4-cylinder in a full-size truck, don\u2019t be. Response off the line is fairly quick, and there\u2019s plenty of power for most jobs. \nThe most popular engine in the Silverado is the 355-horsepower 5.3-liter V8. This is a solid choice in the Silverado, with smooth acceleration and confident power when driving on the freeway and towing. For more horsepower and torque, there\u2019s also a 420-horsepower V8. For those who want to get the setup with the maximum towing capacity, or just love the torquey, smooth acceleration of a diesel engine, that\u2019s available too. The 3.0-liter diesel engine offers 495 lb-ft of torque. \nThe Silverado drives smaller than it is, and has a comfortable ride. Braking and steering feel natural and nicely predictable. If you want a truck with an even nicer ride, the upscale, luxurious High Country trim is available with adaptive ride control. On the other end of the spectrum, the most rugged, trail-ready ZR2 has an off-road-biased suspension and wheel and tire package. It also has skid plates and comes standard with 4-wheel drive. \nPayload and Towing \nDepending on engine and cab, payload capacity ranges from 1,520 to 2,260 pounds. For the setup with the most payload capacity, look for a 2-wheel-drive Silverado with the 2.7-liter 4-cylinder engine. \nThe Silverado can tow between 8,900 and 13,300 pounds depending on configuration. If towing is your highest priority, the Silverado can tow the maximum 13,300-pound capacity with the turbodiesel engine. If you prefer gas, the 6.2-liter V8 tows up to 13,200 pounds. \nFuel Economy \nWith the highly sought-after 5.3-liter V8 and 4-wheel-drive combo, fuel economy for the Chevy Silverado is 17 mpg combined, slightly lower than the similarly equipped Ford F-150. Looking at all the engine options, fuel economy is pretty much in line with the other full-size trucks on the market. The 3.0-liter turbodiesel offers the best fuel economy you can get in the Silverado, at 26 combined mpg. That, plus its excellent towing capacity, make this engine a compelling choice. \nWhen it comes to engine choices, the Silverado (and its GMC Sierra sibling) and F-150 are available with turbo 4-cylinders or V8 engines. The F-150, Tundra, and Ram 1500 are also available with twin-turbo 6-cylinder engines. \nPractical, Clean Interior\nThe Chevrolet Silverado 1500\u2019s interior is practical and well laid out. There is room for three to six people, depending on the cab. There is plenty of headroom, and in crew cab models, rear-seat legroom is a spacious 43.4 inches. That\u2019s very good for a full-size truck. The seats are comfortable, and the interior is quiet. \nThe levels of tech and features vary based on trim level. While that\u2019s the case with many full-size trucks, it\u2019s more noticeable with the Silverado, as recent updates to the touchscreen and other tech do not come to the Work Truck and Custom trims, which get a 7-inch touchscreen \u2014 a bit small by today\u2019s standards. \nThe LT and higher trims receive a 13.4-inch touchscreen and a 12.3-inch digital gauge screen with a driver information center. These two additions add a modern touch of flair to a somewhat subdued cabin. The overall design is conservative \u2013 nothing wrong with that \u2013 until you get up to the luxurious High Country. That trim level adds two-tone leather seating, more woodgrain on the dash and doors, and lux touches that are elegant but not gaudy. \nChevy added clever storage touches inside the cab, with enough added pockets, cup holders, and cubbies to make the interior as functional as a pair of cargo pants. There are even hidden storage nooks in the centers of the rear seat cushions. The Silverado is available as a 3-passenger regular cab and as a 5-6-passenger double cab and crew cab. \nTough, Functional Exterior\nThe 2025 Silverado is designed for work duty, but the exterior also offers styling choices that are unique to the trim you choose. Grille designs and wheel options are different, for instance, and the Trail Boss adds a lifted suspension and mud terrain tires. The ZR2 takes that to the most extreme in the lineup, with the most aggressive wheel and tire package, plus skid plates. \nThe Silverado offers the choice of an 8-foot, 6.5-foot, or 5-3/4-foot bed. If you want the long bed, your only choice is the crew cab. Beds have 12 tie-down points, a corner bed step, and LED lighting in all but the Work Truck trim. You also have your choice of a regular tailgate, power up/down tailgate, or the versatile, reconfigurable Multi-Flex tailgate. \nThis year, new 20-inch high-gloss black wheels are available. Cypress Gray and Riptide Blue are new exterior colors for 2025. \nFavorite Features\nMulti-Flex tailgate \nIf the interior is like cargo pants, this tailgate is the Swiss Army knife. Depending on how you fold it, this tailgate can serve as a bed step, work surface, bed extender, and more. \nTrailering tech \nThe in-vehicle trailering app lets you test trailer lights, will sound an alert if someone tries to disconnect the trailer, and lets you set up a pre-departure checklist before towing. \nTrailer camera system \nAvailable for LTZ and higher trim levels, this camera system gives you 14 views of your truck and trailer, including one view that shows an unobstructed view of the road behind the trailer. \nCreative storage \nIn addition to storing gear under the rear seat, there are two glove boxes, plus storage spaces in the center of the rear-seat cushions. For trucks equipped with a front bench seat, there\u2019s more hidden storage under that seat. \nSuper Cruise \nSuper Cruise lets you safely drive with your hands off the wheel. It works on more than 400,000 miles of specially designated roads in North America. It also works when you\u2019re towing. It\u2019s available in the High Country trim. \nWi-Fi \nThe Silverado isn\u2019t just built for work like towing and hauling; it can also be set up for mobile office duty. Connect to the truck\u2019s Wi-Fi, and you\u2019re ready to attend meetings, check inventory, and reach out to suppliers. \nEngine & Transmission\nThe engine in the most affordable trim levels is a 2.7-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder. Its 310 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque is more than sufficient for most people. It uses an 8-speed automatic transmission and is available with 2- or 4-wheel drive. \nThe most popular engine, the 5.3-liter V8, makes 355 horsepower and 383 lb-ft of torque. Also available with 2- or 4-wheel drive, this engine is standard in the LTZ and High Country, and optional in the Work Truck, LT, RST, and Trail Boss trims. It\u2019s backed by a 10-speed automatic transmission. \nFor extra oomph and more exhilarating acceleration, there\u2019s the 6.2-liter V8, which also uses the 10-speed automatic. This engine has 420 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. It comes standard with 4-wheel drive and is available with the RST, LT Trail Boss, LTZ, High Country, and ZR2. \nThe fourth engine in the lineup is a 3.0-liter 6-cylinder, 305-horsepower turbodiesel. It has 495 lb-ft of torque, as well as the best fuel economy of the line. The turbodiesel comes standard on the ZR2 and is available on the Custom Trail Boss, LT, LT Trail Boss, RST, LTZ, and High Country. \n3-Year/36,000-Mile Warranty \nChevrolet\u2019s new-vehicle warranty lasts three years or 36,000 miles, whichever happens first. Powertrains are covered for five years or 60,000 miles. These are typical for the class. Roadside assistance is also provided for the same term as the powertrain. And the first scheduled maintenance service is free. \nSafety ratings \nThe Chevy Silverado 1500 Crew Cab did fairly well in crash-testing performed by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) with scores of Good in the main categories, except for a Marginal in the front passenger-side small overlap impact.

It's available in a variety of trim levels including the base Work Truck, the well-equipped LT, the rugged Trail Boss and the loaded High Country. And there's also the off-road ZR2 version. There's plenty to pick from in the powertrain department too. Its standard turbocharged four-cylinder engine is no slouch \u2014 it produces more torque than the 5.3-liter V8 and almost as much as the 6.2-liter V8. Chevy also offers a turbodiesel engine for the Silverado, which is significant because both the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500 no longer do. The diesel engine is pricey but provides the best combo of power and fuel economy.\nCost to DriveCost to drive estimates for the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Work Truck 2dr Regular Cab SB (2.7L 4cyl Turbo 8A) and comparison vehicles are based on 15,000 miles per year (with a mix of 55% city and 45% highway driving) and energy estimates of $4.85 per gallon for regular unleaded in California.\nMonthly estimates based on costs in California\n$306/mo \u00a0for Silverado 1500 Work Truck\nSilverado 1500 Work Truck\nvs\n$325/mo\nAvg.

But the light-duty truck segment is extremely competitive. The F-150 offers some helpful features, such as a robust onboard generator, that you can't get on the Silverado, while the Ram 1500 and Toyota Tundra have their own distinctive appeal. Check out our test team's in-depth Expert Rating below for a complete report on the Silverado's utility, tech, performance and more.\nEdmunds Expert Rating\nOur VerdictThe Edmunds Vehicle Testing Team evaluates a fresh batch of vehicles every week, pairing objective assessments at our test track with real-world driving on city streets, freeways and winding roads. The data we gather results in our Expert Ratings. They\u2019re based on 30-plus scores that cover every aspect of the automotive experience.\nAverage\n7.5\nout of 10\nedmunds TESTED\nThe 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 stays true to its old-school roots, and the latest updates to the interior and technology do a lot to help this truck be more competitive against its full-size rivals. But lackluster comfort and value keep it from being a top pick.\nRated for you by America's best test team.\nPerformance\n7.5/10\nHow does the Silverado 1500 drive? We tested a Silverado crew cab in the High Country trim with the 5.3-liter V8 and four-wheel drive. Acceleration and braking are sufficient for daily driving or towing. Our test truck covered 60 mph in about 7 seconds from a standstill at our test track. An equivalent F-150 is a little quicker, but there's nothing wrong with the Silverado's power. Around town, the transmission shifts smoothly and makes the most of the engine's low-end torque.  \nThe truck tracks straight on the highway, but the steering effort is a bit too light. Handling is secure, and body roll is effectively held in check as you navigate turns. But midcorner bumps can upset the Silverado pretty easily. Going off-road? A regular 4WD Silverado will suffice, but consider getting the Z71 off-road option package or the Trail Boss trim level to enhance its potential.\nRead more\nComfort\n7/10\nHow comfortable is the Silverado 1500? The Silverado's seating isn't quite as plush as the seats in the F-150 or Ram 1500, yet there's enough padding and support to keep you comfortable on long drives. The ride is relatively smooth on the highway, and the truck ably absorbs most small impacts. But it can get bouncy when you drive on roads that have a high frequency of bumps and dips.  \nThe climate system easily heats and cools the cabin, though operating it can be a little tricky because a lot of the control buttons are small. We really like the optional ventilated and split-heated front seats (separate settings for the seatback and seat cushion), a GM-exclusive feature. Engine noise is effectively muted until you get aggressive with the throttle, at which point it gets a bit unpleasant.\nRead more\nInterior\n7.5/10\nHow\u2019s the interior? Chevrolet finally provided the sorely needed interior upgrade Silverado owners have wanted for years. The latest cabin design looks and feels far more modern than the one used for the 2019-2021 trucks, with sporty elements on the ZR2 trim and upscale materials on top-tier trims like the High Country. Importantly, most of the controls are easy to use, a staple of the previous model, with large clear buttons and a swift touchscreen.  \nInside, the Silverado has plenty of space for adults in its crew-cab configuration. This is particularly evident in the back seat, which has massive legroom to offer. Some models sit high off the ground, but large door openings and proper seat positioning make overall accessibility a positive experience.\nRead more\nContinue reading Edmunds Expert Rating below\nSave as much as $11,026\u00a0with Edmunds Click on the trim you\u2019re interested in to see what Edmunds suggests you should pay to get a good deal.

Technology is a strong point in the Silverado. An available 13.4-inch touchscreen offers a wide range of capability without confusing the user, and the hi-res screen responds quickly to clicks and swipes. There are also clear maps, and navigation finds addresses and points of interest quickly. Plus, the Google-powered voice recognition system understands natural language and reads your command back to you on the screen. With your voice, you can change the station, adjust the climate control and more.  \nOur test truck came with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, both with wireless connectivity. CarPlay looked great on the massive screen. There's a dedicated storage space for your smartphone, and some models include a wireless charger. Driver aids are abundant, with several available exterior cameras that help when parking this behemoth of a truck. The rear cross-traffic warning system and its helpful buzzes in the seat bottom are effective too.  \nAdaptive cruise control generally works well, particularly for such a large vehicle. However, we did experience one instance with our test truck where it unexpectedly lurched forward with the system on in stop-and-go traffic; our driver had to quickly apply the brakes to override it. This put a stain on an otherwise positive experience. GM's hands-free driver assist technology, Super Cruise, is available but only on the top-trim High Country \u2014 Ford offers its similar BlueCruise system on several F-150 trims.\nRead more\nTowing and Storage\n8/10\nHow are the towing and storage? We tested a 5.3-liter V8-powered, short-bed 4WD crew-cab truck that had the standard 3.23 axle gearing. This configuration provided plenty of towing and hauling capability for our needs. As for the bed itself, it's a bit longer, deeper and wider than its rivals, and it has more tie-downs.  \nThe Silverado's boxy center console contains multiple pockets, but we've found the F-150's and Ram 1500's center consoles to be a little more versatile for storing items. For family duty, the crew cab's back seat has two sets of lower car seat anchors and three top tethers, so child safety seats will fit in any of the three positions. But loading the seats, not to mention the kiddos, might be difficult due to the truck's ride height.\nRead more\nContinue reading Edmunds Expert Rating below\nConsider these recommendations\nFuel Economy\n7.5/10\nHow\u2019s the fuel economy? The Silverado High Country we tested had the 5.3-liter V8 and 4WD, which earns an EPA-estimated 18 mpg in combined city/highway driving. We found that number to be reasonably achievable in the real world. The best fuel economy for the Silverado comes from the available diesel-fueled six-cylinder.\nValue\n6.5/10\nIs the Silverado 1500 a good value? The Silverado isn't outrageously expensive, but it is priced higher than its key rivals without offering any advantages in features, style or interior quality. The buttons and dashboard plastics are similar to those in the previous-gen truck: sturdy but somewhat cheap-looking. Chevy's warranty coverage is average, though you do get the first scheduled maintenance for free.\nRead more\nWildcard\n7/10\nFull-size trucks such as the Silverado aren't necessarily fun to drive. But with its commanding view of the road, lots of towing power, and brutish front-end styling, the Silverado can put a smile on your face. However, the interior looks dated and borrows many pieces and design cues from the previous generation. It may or may not be the full-size truck personality you want.\nRead more\nWhich Silverado 1500 does Edmunds recommend?\nThe sheer variety of configurations and options makes it difficult to recommend a singular Silverado for every buyer. But broadly, the LT trim is a good place to start your research. It comes with a pleasing mix of features for the price, and it's the first trim in the Silverado lineup that offers three engine choices including the diesel.\nCompare 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 trim levels\nHelpful trims summary and side-by-side comparison chart\nChevrolet Silverado 1500 models\nThe 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is a full-size pickup available in nine trim levels: Work Truck (WT), Custom, Custom Trail Boss, LT, RST, LT Trail Boss, ZR2, LTZ and High Country. Like most full-size trucks, the Silverado is offered in varying cab and bed configurations, including a two-door regular cab, a four-door extended cab (Double Cab), and a four-door crew cab with full-size rear doors and generous rear seat room. Depending on cab selection, the three available bed sizes are an 8-foot-long bed, a 6.5-foot bed and a shorter 5-foot-8-inch bed. Keep reading for our editorial team's rundown of the Silverado's engines and features.\nChevrolet offers four available engines for the Silverado 1500:\n\nTurbocharged 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine (310 hp, 430 lb-ft) with an eight-speed automatic transmission\n5.3-liter V8 engine (355 hp, 383 lb-ft) with a 10-speed automatic transmission\n6.2-liter V8 engine (420 hp, 460 lb-ft) with a 10-speed automatic transmission\nTurbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder diesel engine (305 hp, 495 lb-ft) with a 10-speed automatic transmission\n\nWe've noted which engines come standard or optional on each trim. Rear-wheel drive is typically standard, with four-wheel drive an option. Other Silverado feature highlights include:\nWT\nThe basic Silverado Work Truck comes standard with the four-cylinder engine but the 5.3-liter V8 is available at an additional cost. Other standard features include:\n\nVinyl seat upholstery\nRubber floor covering\nAir conditioning\nPower windows and door locks\n7-inch touchscreen\nWireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto\n\nThe Work Truck also includes these advanced driver aids:\n\nForward collision warning with automatic braking (warns you of an impending collision and applies the brakes in certain scenarios)\nLane departure warning (alerts you if the vehicle begins to drift out of its lane)\nLane keeping assistance (steers the Silverado back into its lane if it begins to drift over the lane marker)\n\nCustom\nThe Custom trim improves the Silverado's appearance and allows for the extended- or crew-cab configuration. It is only available with the four-cylinder engine and includes:\n\nRemote engine start\nCruise control\nCloth upholstery\nLED cargo bed lighting\nPower-adjustable, heated exterior mirrors\nPower-adjustable driver's seat\nTrailering package\n120-volt power outlets\nHitch guidance lines for backup camera\n\nCustom Trail Boss\nThe Trail Boss has the four-cylinder engine standard; the 5.3-liter V8 or the six-cylinder diesel is optional. It equips the Custom with the look and capability of an off-road truck by adding:\n\nFour-wheel drive\nTwo-speed transfer case\nUnderbody skid plates\nZ71 off-road suspension package\n18-inch wheels with all-terrain tires\nAutomatic locking rear differential\nHill descent control\n\nLT\nThe Silverado LT offers the same engines as the Custom Trail Boss. It adds to the Custom trim features with:\n\nLED headlights\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nKeyless ignition and entry\n12.3-inch digital gauge cluster display\n13.4-inch infotainment touchscreen\nEnhanced Google-based voice control system\nPower-adjustable driver's seat\nHeated front seats\nHeated leather-wrapped steering wheel\n\nRST\nThe RST trim is the first Silverado trim that you can get the big V8. Otherwise, it essentially adds a sport-truck appearance to the Silverado LT.\nLT Trail Boss\nThis version of the Trail Boss can be had with any of the four engine choices and builds on the Custom Trail Boss trim by adding:\n\nLED headlights\nPower-adjustable driver's seat\nHeated front seats\nDual-zone automatic climate control\nHeated leather-wrapped steering wheel\n\nZR2\nThe off-road-focused ZR2 trim is only available with the 6.2-liter V8 or the diesel six-cylinder. Four-wheel drive is standard. In addition to the LT Trail Boss features, you get:\n\n33-inch all-terrain tires\nOff-road-specific suspension dampers\nUpgraded skid plates\nFull-size spare tire\nSpray-in bedliner\nElectronic locking front and rear differentials\nPower-adjustable front passenger seat\nVentilated front seats\nWireless smartphone charging\nBose audio system\nHeated rear seats\nSeven-speaker Bose premium audio\nBlind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic warning (alerts you if a vehicle is in your blind spot during a lane change or while reversing)\nSurround-view camera system\n\nThe ZR2 Bison Edition package is only available on the ZR2. It adds styling elements and more off-road capability with:\n\n18-inch black wheels with 33-inch mud-terrain tires\nStronger skid plates for the front underbody, transfer case, rear differential and fuel tank\nUpgraded front and rear bumpers that improve approach and departure angles\nSteel rocker panel protection\nUnique grille\nBison and American Expedition Vehicles (AEV) interior and exterior badging and decals\n\nLTZ\nOne of two premium versions of the Silverado, the LTZ is only available as a crew cab and is offered with all engines except for the four-cylinder. It builds on the LT trim with:\n\n20-inch wheels\nPower-folding mirrors\nPower tailgate\nPerimeter (exterior) lighting\nBucket front seats with center console\nPower-adjustable front passenger seat\nLeather upholstery\nVentilated front seats\nBose premium audio system\nWireless smartphone charging\nAdditional towing aid features\nFront and rear parking sensors\nBlind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic warning (alerts you if a vehicle is in your blind spot during a lane change or while reversing)\nSurround-view camera system\n\nHigh Country\nFor maximum luxury, the Silverado High Country offers:\n\nEnhanced LED headlights\nRunning board side assist steps\nSpray-in bedliner\nHeated rear seats\nAdaptive cruise control (maintains a driver-set distance between the Silverado and the car in front)\n\nMany features offered on upper trim levels are available on supporting models as packages or stand-alone options. Notably, the Super Cruise semi-automated highway driving system is only available on the top High Country trim. Numerous trailer monitoring systems that allow for trailer tire-pressure sensors or trailer rearview-camera connections are also available.\nEdmunds Latest Chevrolet Silverado 1500 News\n Edmunds Tested: Electric Car Range and Consumption Chevy Corvette Z06 vs. Maserati MC20: Edmunds U-Drags Mid-Engine Battle Chevy Traverse Cargo Test: How Much Can You Fit Behind the Third Row? 2025 Chevy Corvette ZR1 Pricing: $175K Base, $206K Loaded\nRead more\nChevrolet Silverado 1500 Reviews\nOwner Reviews\n4.4 out of 5 stars 33 reviews\n5(76%)\n4(6%)\n3(6%)\n2(9%)\n1(3%)\nWrite a vehicle reviewSee all 33 reviews\nMost Helpful Owner Reviews\nTrending topics\n\nride quality\nengine\nfuel efficiency\nappearance\ninterior\ndriving experience\nvalue\nspaciousness\ntowing\nhandling & steering\nacceleration\noff-roading\nsteering wheel\nsound system\nbrakes\ndoors\nreliability & manufacturing quality\nclimate control\nsafety\ncup holders\ninfotainment system\ntechnology\nseats\nwarranty\ndashboard\n\nMore\n2024 Silverado Cam Sensor Position 594 miles!\n1 out of 5 stars\nGeorge Owings Mills, MD, 08/27/2024\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Custom 4dr Crew Cab 4WD 6.6 ft. SB (2.7L 4cyl Turbo 8A)\nJust bought a Silverado Custom with 2.7 Turbomax 4 cycl. With 594 miles on it, it starts shaking and shimmying at a light. Hit the gas and the engine is shaking like crazy. Take it back to dealer and 2 cylinders needed to be replaced! Heritage Chevrolet in Owings Mills, MD would not switch out the truck for a new one. I am beyond vexed because that truck will never be the same. I\u00a0\u2026 can care less about a warranty. How about do right by your customers and take back a defective product and fight it out with GM for sending you a bad truck! The customer always gets the short end of the stick.\nRead more\nRead less\nNew diesel owner\n5 out of 5 stars\nScott Langlais, 04/22/2024\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 ZR2 4dr Crew Cab 4WD 5.8 ft. SB (3.0L 6cyl Turbodiesel 10A)\nThis is my first diesel truck. I went with the 3.0 Duramax. I was concerned it would not have enough power as I pull a lot of construction trailers. I am so pleased with this truck. I might not accelerate as fast as the 6.2 gas motor, but nobody needs to accelerate like that in the first place. Especially 1 pollen trailers. This is a very smooth truck and I am averaging above 18 mpg with\u00a0\u2026 consistent runs with my dump trailer.\nRead more\nRead less\nOver All good\n5 out of 5 stars\nRuss427, 03/06/2024\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LTZ 4dr Crew Cab 4WD 6.6 ft. SB (5.3L 8cyl 10A)\nIt's almost everything I wanted. But no moon roof or sliding back glass. Major flaw is the auto shut off when stopping. Have to shut that off every time I get in the truck. Also don't like the timer shut off when outside the truck. Not safe for people who are waiting inside the truck in hot/cold weather. No way to override it.\nTruck for work or pleasure\n5 out of 5 stars\nValor Trooper , 09/24/2024\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LTZ 4dr Crew Cab 5.8 ft. SB (5.3L 8cyl 10A)\nI traded a 2020 Chevy Silverado LTZ crew cab, leather seats, black exterior color, short bed, 4x4 with Z71 options, 8 speed transmission, and 5.3 v8 for a 2024 Chevy Silverado LTZ crew cab, leather seats, metallic silver color, short bed, 4x4 minus the Z71 options, 10 speed transmission, and 5.3 v8. The 2024 Chevy Silverado has options( automatic steps, multi purpose tailgate, heads up\u00a0\u2026 display, 22 inch tires w/chrome wheels, power sun roof, power rear center window, and sprayed bed liner) some of which were not part of the 2020 Chevy Silverado. The 2024 Chevy minus the Z71 option with 22 inch wheels and road style tires rides a bit smoother than my 2020 Chevy. I still maintain the 4x4 capability when needed especially with the Illinois winters and some mild off road traveling. The shift/gear selector is now located on the center console rather than the steering column which provides no inconvenience for either use or position placement. At my senior age of 81 and before I have always enjoyed my trucks and have had quite a few including Chevy, GMC, Ford, & Toyota trucks. The 2024 Silverado LTZ continues to be a pricey purchase as truck prices across the brand spectrum are all pricey purchases. I am pleased with my 2024 Silverado with regard to performance and design. This is my first metallic silver exterior color which looks great and reflects the sun heat better than my previous black exterior colored trucks. If price is not a limiting factor, I believe you would enjoy owning and driving a full size 1500, Silverado LTZ.\nRead more\nRead less\nSee all 33 reviews of the Chevrolet Silverado 1500\nWrite a vehicle review\nHelpful shopping links\n\n\nSee All for Sale\n\n\nBuild & Price\n\n\nDeals & Incentives\n\n\nLease Offers\n\n\nPrice Checker\u2122\n\n\nShop Used\n\n\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 videos\nFord F-150 Lightning TOW TEST! | Real-World Truck Towing Comparison | EV vs. Diesel, Gas & Hybrid\nFord F-150 Lightning TOW TEST! | Real-World Truck Towing Comparison | EV vs. Diesel, Gas & Hybrid\nNOTE: This video is about the 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 1500, but since the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is part of the same generation, our earlier analysis still applies.\n\n Ford F-150 Lightning TOW TEST! | Real-World Truck Towing Com...\n The Updated 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 | It's Refreshed B...\n Best Trucks Under $60K | Which Pickups Offer the Best Bang f...\n 2022 Chevy Silverado ZR2 First Drive | Off-Roading in the Ne...\n\n\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Features & Specs\nType:\nCrew Cab\nTrim:\nWork Truck\n\nBase MSRPExcludes Destination Fee$42,500Engine TypeGasCombined MPG20 MPGCost to Drive$306/monthSeating6 seatsDrivetrainRear Wheel DriveFour Wheel Driverear wheel driveMax Towing Capacity9,500 lbs.Warranty3 years / 36,000 miles\n\nSee all features & specs\n\nCompare the Chevrolet Silverado 1500\n\n\n\nChevrolet\u00a0Silverado 1500\n\nCompare\n\n\n\nFord F-150\n\nCompare\n\n\n\nRam 1500\n\nCompare\n\n\nAdd any vehicle to compare\n\n\nCompare selected vehicles\nChevrolet Silverado 1500 vs. Ford F-150\nThe F-150 outperforms the Silverado in most ways including performance, comfort and value. It offers more engine options, including a hybrid engine that's more powerful than any of the Silverado's engines. The Ford also has a higher towing capacity and can carry more weight in its bed. And when it comes to off-roading, Chevy doesn't have anything like the highly capable Raptor and 700-horsepower Raptor R. To top it off, Ford offers the innovative Pro Power Onboard system. Read Edmunds' long-term road test review of the F-150 Hybrid.\nCompare Chevrolet Silverado 1500 & Ford F-150 features\u00a0\nChevrolet Silverado 1500 vs. Ram 1500\nThe Ram 1500 is an excellent alternative to the Silverado especially if you prefer superior ride comfort and a luxurious interior. Topping the Ram's lineup is the insane 702-horsepower TRX, which is quicker and more capable than the ZR2. Ram also offers the convenient RamBox in-bed locking bins. The Ram 1500, however, doesn't have a hands-free driving system like Super Cruise. Read Edmunds' long-term road test review of the Ram 1500.\nCompare Chevrolet Silverado 1500 & Ram 1500 features\u00a0\nChevrolet Silverado 1500 vs. Toyota Tundra\nThe Tundra is a well-rounded pickup powered by a turbocharged V6 or a powerful hybrid version of that engine. It offers an attractive interior with an optional, impressive-looking 14-inch touchscreen display. The TRD Pro model delivers solid capability, but you'll likely be more impressed with the ZR2, especially the Bison Edition. The Tundra offers not only fewer engine choices but also fewer cab and bed configurations than the Chevy, and it has a lower max towing capacity.\nCompare Chevrolet Silverado 1500 & Toyota Tundra features\u00a0\n\nPRICE CHECKER\u2122\nCheck a dealer's price\nBring back a dealer's quote, and we'll tell you if it's a good price!\nBased on nearby sales up through February 10th\nYou should take it!\nGood Price:\n8388,888380\nGraph shown is a sample only\nGet started\n\nAdvertisement  Build Your 2024 Silverado 1500  At a Glance: * 1 Trim * $36,800starting MSRP  Build & Price Chevrolet.comDisclaimer\n*The Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price excludes destination freight charge, tax, title, license, dealer fees and optional equipment.

Seems like the right rear, when trucks sit 4 to 8hrs. Sometimes backing up releases or slowly moving forward. Transmission slips in low gear when engine is cold, or as it sits. Sometimes I think if the auto shut off is off it doesn't slip. Some times when truck down shift coasting to a stop. Auto shut of is to sensitive and jerk starts sometimes.

Did you?\nYes No\n3.0 Duramax is awesome\nFebruary 26, 2022\nBy Happy owner from Lubbock Texas\nOwns this car\nI\u2019ve had many silverados in my years, all 1/2 tons since \u201877. Enjoyed most of them. Can\u2019t say much about the 700R4 transmission in the 90\u2019s however. But this 2020 Silverado RST little max is the trophy of them all. It\u2019s a fuel sipper with plenty of torque, which is awesome for towing. It averages 12 mpg towing and 30-34 mpg non towing. The 10 speed transmission performance is so smooth shifting, the performance of the little 3.0 is engineering at its best. I traded a 2016 Silverado Z71 5.3 for this truck. Wow, it puts that old \u201816 to shame. The truck is simply the best of the best in the 1/2 ton class. I have driven it 20k now and the only issue I\u2019ve had was the my link freezing up several times in a couple weeks time frame. Took it to the dealer in Biloxie as I was on a road trip and they reflashed the system. Whatever that did, that was a couple months back and issue has not reappeared. It has all the bells and whistles with the first Bose system I\u2019ve ever had in my 70 years. This is a phenomenal truck and I expect it will be my last. I can\u2019t imagine parting with it. I never hesitated buying this truck after my initial test drive in Lubbock, Texas. I was not able to make a deal in my hometown here and was able to make a deal over the phone with a Chevrolet dealership in Farmersbranch, Texas. It\u2019s sad another Chevrolet dealership 400 miles from my home can make a much greater deal than my local dealership. That\u2019s free enterprise however and for what this truck cost, you have to shop your best deal. I feel like I got a great deal and absolutely no regrets. The all around ownership experience of this Silverado has exceeded my expectations.

My 2023 ZR2 with 6.2L averaged 15 MPG and required 93 octane which is $0.30-0.40/gal higher than diesel. I had no issues at 40K with 2023, just didn\u2019t like fuel economy/range of 6.2L. 3.0L DuraMax in my 2024 uses 1 gal DEF every 800-900 miles. Goes through sand, mud, and snow off road. 33\u201d tires and 2\u201d factory lift, manual front and rear lockers, and Multimactic DVSS shocks make it an off road beast.

The 5.3L v8 dynamic fuel management engine and 10 speed transmission provide a smooth yet powerful feel, which allows the \"skip fire\" engine to operate with as little as 2 cylinders under light load conditions. This system keeps all cylinders lubed and warm to prevent previous technology pitfalls while delivering excellent fuel economy (up to 25mpg). This keeps the \"gismo\" engine / system tricks of the other brands out of this truck. Additionally, I believe this LTZ is the best-looking full-size truck in the GM (and many competitive brand) lineups. The looks, features, interior room and fuel economy are all best of class. If you are looking for one, don't mess around find one with premium features.

Truck ran fine until 20,000 miles when it suffered lifter collapse and bent rods on the passenger side of the engine. Shame on me for not researching before I purchased but it appears that Chevy has been knowingly installing defective lifters in their 5.3L engines for quite a few years. My build date was right in the sweet spot for defective lifters. Unfortunately, Chevy will only warranty a repair on the side of the engine that failed even though they know that the other side will fail at some point. So, my dealer did the warranty repair and handed me back the keys to my ticking time bomb. How can put my family in the truck and decide to leave town when I am rolling the dice on whether I will make it to my destination?\n\nI had no choice but to trade it for a Ford F150. Fortunately, I did not suffer any transmission issues when I owned it but I have had several failures of the 10-speed transmissions on several of the vehicles in my work fleet. I read recently about a class action suit about the transmission issues. While I owned my Silverado before my issues began, I decided to get a Blazer for my work vehicle. It has 12,000 miles and has already suffered a transmission failure. Chevrolet/GM needs to get a handle on their reliability/quality. I'm officially done with them and will never own another of their offerings.\n\nReviewed Feb. 5, 2025\n\n23 Silverado Trailboss. I'm on my 3rd radiator, 3rd battery and 3rd intercooler. Now waiting 3 months for a coolant valve. Truck sits broke for 3 months. GM can't even get a part expedited to dealership and refuses to reimburse my car rental. Their customer service is non existent. I would never buy or recommend gm to anybody. I wouldn't even take a free truck from them. I'm disappointed. How can they keep selling these things knowing the parts are bad for 4 years now they've known and keep producing and selling.\n\nNot sure how to choose?\n\nGet buying tips about Car Models delivered to your inbox.\n\nThanks for subscribing.\n\nYou have successfully subscribed to our newsletter! Enjoy reading our tips and recommendations.\n\nReviewed Jan. 21, 2025\n\nI own a 2022 Silverado LT V8 4wd. I purchased this vehicle new from a local GM dealership. The vehicle currently has 38,590 miles, it has been kept up to vehicle preventative maintenance specs. Yesterday the power steering went out. I have an extended warranty through MBPI which should cover the replacement of the part but thank god I was driving the vehicle yesterday because my wife would not have been able to make any sharp turns or turns at all. I have never had this happen on a vehicle before.\n\nThe vehicle is now at the dealership but there is a two week backlog for appointments. I am a retired combat veteran (21years) and have 100% VA disability. I contacted GM customer service about getting a rental or loaner and they said since it is over 36k miles I am out of luck. I can get a rental, once the truck is looked at and it is determined that over 4 hours is needed to repair the vehicle through my extended warranty. So I am out a vehicle until then. GM are within their legal right but their morals and customer service is lacking. I will never buy another GM product again. Hell my F150 treated me better.\n\nReviewed Dec. 26, 2024\n\nI purchased a new 2024 Silverado RST Electric Pickup truck for its safety features and super cruise. The system has failed over 14 times while driving and has been in the dealer shop over five times by my records. They haven\u2019t documented the additional visits because I raised the issue of the vehicle being a lemon, and multiple service repairs would justify the lemon status of the Silverado E RST Pickup truck. Each time they tell me different problems, they updated the firmware, rebooted the systems twice, and they tell me that the communication board has failed which affects the self-driving (super cruise) and all the other safety functions i.e. breaking, collision, etc. After having the car for a week, the Silverado RST almost drove me into a bridge wall at 60 miles per hour.\n\nI wanted to return the vehicle as being dangerous, unsafe and not usable for its intended purpose. They suggested I trade in my current $100,000 new Silverado RST vehicle (1 week old) for a value of $78,000, as the Silverado RST is a used vehicle now for a new 2025 Silverado RST and pay an additional $17,000. I am told since its new model year they have only one tech to fix the new electronics at the Chevrolet Millennium dealer. I\u2019ve been told Chevrolet is sending down their engineer to check the vehicle but hasn\u2019t shown up for over a month. I have been given many excuses with no resolutions however they have always been polite. This morning on 12-26-24, driving on the Southern State Parkway, the super cruise lost control and couldn\u2019t find the road per the display and drove straight through the curve toward the other lanes, fortunately I didn\u2019t crash.\n\nMy new 2025 Mercedes CLE 450 has all the same safety features as self-driving assist, and it works beautifully and has never failed. To add insult to injury the Chevy personnel praise Mercedes for their quality this morning as I dropped off the Silverado RST. For a $97,000 vehicle to have all these problems unresolved with intermittent safety failures I would never recommend this vehicle, I believe this vehicle is a lemon and unsafe. I am filing a Lemon Law claim because I don't believe the safety features are reliable, which is the principal reason why I purchased the Silverado E RST vehicle. I wouldn't recommend to any of my family members to purchase the Silverado E RST or any Chevrolet vehicle based upon my experience with Chevrolet over the last seven weeks. This is the first time in twenty years I bought an American vehicle to my dismay.\n\nReviewed Dec. 2, 2024\n\nPurchased new 2023 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Trail Boss with the 3.0 diesel. It has been sitting in the shop waiting for a part since August. I was just made aware that it will be another 2 months before they get the part. 6 months-1/2 a year of me paying on the truck to have it sitting at O\u2019Reilly Chevrolet. Do not purchase a truck from Chevrolet!\n\nReviewed Nov. 27, 2024\n\nI just recently purchased a 2024 Chevy Silverado 2500. I was extremely excited about my new truck and was quite happy with the dealership. Unfortunately when I went to pick the truck up, I was informed it had a dent in the rear driver side door. I was told they will take care of the dent no charge, but I would need to come back on a Saturday as that's the only day that department works. The issue lies in that I live 1.5 hours away from the dealership and was told they were the only ones that could perform the work.\n\nAbout a month after I had my truck, the cover on top on the passenger side mirror flies off, to which I had to go into the local dealership and have it repaired under warranty. Now just yesterday (3 months after I bought it) I noticed one of the lights on the roof isn't working. So once again I'm having to go to the local dealership to have another warranty fix completed. So, this is 3 warranty issues in less than 4 months of purchasing a $70,000 truck. I'm beginning to get very frustrated with my new Chevy and am thinking twice about every purchasing another one again.\n\nReviewed Nov. 5, 2024\n\nI am on my second 2500Hd Silverado. I am writing this review because on the very first service at 7600 miles I was told that my tires were excessively wearing. The first truck I had the tires were worn out at 23000 miles and the ones on my 2024 will be lucky to see 12000 miles. I called GM customer service and was told if the truck had less than 12000 miles on it that they should cover the tires under warranty so I took it to the dealer to have them look at it again. After a week they called me back and said that unless the tires were defective they could not replace them. The tires are Goodyear Wranglers so now I'm going to be out 2000 dollars for tires because GM must have used covid leftover tires. DO NOT BUY A 2500 WITH THE GOODYEAR TIRES. Looks like my next one will be a f250.\n\nReviewed Oct. 28, 2024\n\nDon't buy a Chevy. I have a truck that is 2 years old and 70 thousand miles old, and I have a catalyst problem already. Not only that, but they have issues with the radio\u2014many problems. You a favor and don't buy a Chevy. They are not the same substantial trucks anymore. They use so much electrical stuff. They make trucks with a bunch of problems.\n\nReviewed Oct. 27, 2024\n\nI was driving to work and my check engine light came on and said reduced engine power! Come to find out a lifter broke! Then the camshaft and rockers broke! Since 60600 miles they said warranty was out! 2900 bucks later back on the road! They informed me that they have been having problems with the lifter! But they couldn\u2019t help me out! The truck is two years old. First time I bought a Chevy! Should have stayed with Ford. I will never buy another General Motors vehicle again!\n\nReviewed Sept. 24, 2024\n\nI just sold my 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LTZ after 8 months, my honest opinion is I am very disappointed, why because of the ride quality, not a pure V8 engine, too much highway noise coming in cabin, and had it in the shop 4 times for software problems, I really hated the, DFM. My second disappointment was the dealership I went to, be very careful and choose your dealership wisely. I will never buy another silverado until they start building real quality trucks. The money I wasted on this truck taught me a valuable lesson, don't settle for less demand quality or don't buy it.\n\nChevrolet Silverado Company Information\n\nConsumerAffairs is not a government agency.

My last truck was a 2002 Chevy Silverado 1500 LS. I drove it 22 years and put over 200,000 miles on it. It was a great truck, so I wanted to replace it with another one. In late November, I purchased a 2024 Silverado 1500 LTZ with all the bells and whistles and I couldn\u2019t be happier with a vehicle. It looks fantastic, Summit White, crew cab with short bed and 20\u201d wheels have it sitting at the perfect height. Inside there is plenty of headroom for 6 ft plus people. The seats are super comfortable and it drives and rides fabulously. The interior is amazing. My wife, who generally doesn\u2019t care much for trucks raves about it every time she sits in it. She says she can\u2019t believe how comfortable it is and wants to take trips in it. If there is anything I have to say that is a bit negative is how the 10 speed transmission works at slow speeds. At times, I experience a sort of surging with it. The truck apparently \u201clearns\u201d your driving habits, so that may have something to do with it. Otherwise, I really enjoy everything about it. Looking for another 20 years with it!:)\nRating breakdown (out of 5):\n\nComfort 5.0\nInterior 5.0\nPerformance 5.0\nValue 4.0\nExterior 5.0\n\nReliability 5.0\n\n\nPurchased a New car\n\nUsed for Commuting\nDoes recommend this car\n\n0 people out of 0 found this review helpful.

The WT model is the least expensive of the line up and comes with the 2.7L 4-cylinder HO motor. It has analog gauges, which I actually prefer over LED displays. The engine pulls like a V8 and sounds more like a small diesel. The 8 speed transmission shifts at the right times and is smooth. Cabin noise is minimal.

SB (2.7L 4cyl Turbo 8A)\n27 of 29 people found this review helpful\nBrand new 2022 Silverado Custom, and my first GM product ever. Less than a month of owning it, one day it decided not to start and the battery was completely dead. I received an e-mail from OnStar saying there was an airbag issue and to contact the dealer within 1 day. This was a Sunday, so I did an online service appointment for Monday. Got the truck in and after going insane about not getting any calls from the dealership days after it had been there, I was told the front collision module was shorting out and a GM engineer was assigned to my truck to diagnose it. After nearly 2 weeks at the dealership, I got the truck back and wouldn't you know, the same issue again. It's back at the dealership and I am now told the GM engineer may have to come to the dealership to diagnose the truck. In addition to the safety issues regarding forward collision detection, the key fob will randomly lock itself inside the vehicle, and the factory paint job is a disaster on the drivers side doors. Never took notice to the paint since I picked it up while it was raining out. In direct sunlight the paint looks like a hologram and I was told by the Sales Manager and Service Dept that it is a factory defect. Piece of junk this truck is and very poor build,\nSafety\n1 out of 5 stars\nTechnology\n2 out of 5 stars\nPerformance\n2 out of 5 stars\nInterior\n2 out of 5 stars\nComfort\n2 out of 5 stars\nReliability\n1 out of 5 stars\nValue\n1 out of 5 stars\nReport Abuse\n\n\n1 out of 5 stars\n2022 chevy trail boss 8 speed transmission junk!!!\nkt, 03/06/2023\n2022 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LT Trail Boss 4dr Crew Cab 4WD 6.6 ft.

Best ive gotten is 28.7 and average over 23 but im not shy with the pedal. There are only 2 things im not fond of, the seats aren't the most comfortable and the new infotainment system is very slow. I came from a ram with Uconnect 5 so I guess I expected more. The position of the screen is much better but the system itself has a 2 or 3 second lag doing almost everything and isn't nearly as configurable.

Here\u2019s what it offers:\nCoverage Duration\nThe Powertrain Warranty typically lasts for 5 years or 60,000 miles, whichever comes first.

Knowing these exclusions ensures you\u2019re prepared and can plan for proper care and maintenance of your truck.\n1.) Routine Maintenance and Wear ItemsThe Powertrain Warranty doesn\u2019t cover everyday maintenance needs or items that naturally wear out over time.This includes:\n2.)

Similarly, damage from external factors like vandalism or collisions would fall under your insurance policy rather than warranty coverage.\nModifications and Non-genuine Parts\nLove customizing your\u00a0Silverado 1500? Be cautious: modifications or the use of non-GM-approved parts can void your warranty in certain areas. For example:\n1.) Installing a non-Chevrolet aftermarket turbocharger\n2.) Using unauthorized engine tuning software to maintain warranty coverage, stick with Genuine GM Parts and accessories designed specifically for your Silverado 1500.\nOther Exclusions\n1.) Cosmetic damage like paint scratches or upholstery wear\n2.) Normal aging of the vehicle (e.g., fading or cracking of materials)\n3.) Repairs for components not explicitly covered, such as infotainment systems or non-drivetrain electrical issues (these may fall under a different warranty).\nHow to Stay Protected\nUnderstanding these exclusions helps you take proactive steps, like keeping up with routine maintenance and choosing GM-certified technicians for any repairs.

Here\u2019s how you can get the most out of your warranty and keep your Silverado running at its best for years to come.\n1. Follow the Recommended Maintenance Schedule\nThe first step in ensuring your\u00a0Silverado 1500\u00a0stays covered under its powertrain warranty is adhering to Chevrolet\u2019s recommended maintenance schedule. Regular oil changes, fluid checks, and tire rotations are vital for keeping your truck running smoothly.

At\u00a0Community Chevrolet, our expert technicians can help keep track of your service needs and ensure your Silverado 1500 gets the best care.

Be sure to save all receipts and service invoices, and make note of the dates and mileage of each service.\n4. Monitor Your Silverado 1500\u2019s Performance\nA little awareness goes a long way in keeping your Silverado 1500\u00a0in prime condition.

That said, you wouldn\u2019t know this segment as being poised on a revolution. Progress in the efficiency and fuel economy of full-size trucks the past few years hasn\u2019t come so rapidly, and it\u2019s fair to sum it up as a series of small steps, canceled strategies, and sometimes contradictory moves.

So the launch of the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado Saturday night before the Detroit auto show was a big deal for the company.

Now there's a zero-emission version, and it's available today. That means that you can acquire one even before this spring's launch of the all-new models with more efficient V-6 and V-8 gasoline engines. There's a slight catch, of course.

Maybe that\u2019s why electric vehicles like the Chevy Bolt EV are so popular. Of course, there are also the environmental benefits of electric cars and the ability to lower one\u2019s carbon footprint. In addition, there are federal tax credits available to those who purchase these vehicles. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the many benefits of electric cars.\nChevy ResearchChevy EV vs. EUV\nTax Benefits of Electric Vehicles\nGenerous government incentives are among the benefits of electric cars. And the federal government provides a generous tax credit of $2,500-$7,500 for drivers who purchase an electric car, like the Chevy Bolt EUV. The State of Iowa doesn\u2019t currently offer incentives for the purchase of EVs by private individuals, however, some utility companies are offering rebates and other incentives. So, check with your utility provider.\nOther Financial Benefits of Electric Cars\nA more affordable North Sioux City commute is definitely one of the financial benefits of electric vehicles. Electric cars don\u2019t use gasoline, so there\u2019s no need to worry about how high gas prices can climb. Furthermore, you\u2019ll never have to pay for another oil change or certain other types of maintenance, because an electric car uses no oil.\nEnvironmental Benefits of Electric Cars\nThe environmental benefits of electric cars are obvious. Electric cars use neither gas nor oil, meaning the more of them that are on the road, the less fossil fuels will be used. And, since they don\u2019t use gas, they produce zero emissions.\nElectric Cars You Can Buy from Knoepfler Chevrolet Co.\nChevrolet is helping to lead the way into the electrified future with two remarkable models and more on the way, soon.

this Post: Share on Facebook Share on Twitter\n\nThere has never been more of an emphasis than there is now on thinking about our environment and how what we do daily affects and changes it. We as consumers are realizing the impact of big and small things we do every day. Trends in environmental attitudes, such as recycling and going waste-free, are growing beyond individual ways of thinking.\nAs a result of being more aware of how what we do affects the environment, consumers are asking not only themselves but the companies they interact with to be more conscious of these concerns. The public has begun to hold companies to a new standard of accountability: to do more than ever before, and to do better, for the environment. Shoppers ask the businesses they support to use cleaner energy, recycle more, and offer environmentally friendly options.\nGeneral Motors and Chevrolet have taken great leaps forward in proving themselves as an environmentally conscious and responsible company. GMC has set goals for all it manufacturing facilities to run on 100-percent renewable power by 2050. The company has already reached 20 percent of that goal. And General Motors/Chevrolet has 152 facilities all around the world that operate without sending any waste at all to landfills. These are just a few of the things they are doing as a company. For a major auto manufacturer, this is astounding.\nOne of the biggest initiatives Chevy has started as a company is offering environmentally conscious and earth-friendly product options to their customers. Chevy provides a whole range of cars for people who want to make a more conscious choice about what they are driving. From fuel efficient gas-powered vehicles to fully electric cars and all the hybrids in between, Chevy has a car that can help you lessen your impact on the environment.\nChevy Cars with High Fuel Efficiency\nOne of the biggest ways Chevy cars are helping the environment is by continuing to develop more and more fuel-efficient vehicles. Chevy offers many car models with an estimated fuel efficiency of 30 mpg or more.\nChevy\u2019s smallest cars use their size and lighter weight to get you more miles between fuel stops. The 2018 Chevy Sonic boasts an average of 30 mpg combined city and highway driving. The 2018 Chevy Spark is even more impressive, with an average 33 mpg for city/highway.\nChevy\u2019s sedan and hatchback models also boast impressive fuel economy. The 2018 Chevy Cruze sedan will get you an average of 33 mpg combined city and highway. Its hatchback counterpart will see an average of 32 mpg. The larger 2018 Chevy Malibu sedan averages 30 mpg combined city and highway.\nThere is a push to go forward with \u201cgreen energy\u201d sources and move away from fossil fuels as fast as possible. With the rising prices of fuel and growing concern about the environmental impact of fuel-burning cars, moving the industry\u2019s thinking toward the production of hybrid and electric cars make sense. This change, though, cannot\u2014and will not\u2014happen overnight.\nWhile Chevy is making great strides with the production of hybrid and electric cars, some of the great options it offers are more fuel-efficient gas-powered cars. This choice allows consumers who cannot afford to make the jump to hybrid and electric vehicles or are simply not ready to do so to lessen the environmental impact of their cars. Going longer between filling the tank and saving money on gas doesn\u2019t hurt, either.\nHybrid Chevy Cars\nHybrid cars are the best of both worlds. Cars that use both fuel and electric engine systems have the advantage of allowing for the efficiency of an electric vehicle but the driving distance of gas-powered cars. Chevy offers two hybrid cars currently: a hybrid version of its popular Malibu and the Chevy Volt. Both cars use different hybrid technologies and features to get the highest fuel efficiency.\nThe 2017 Chevy Malibu Hybrid and 2017 Chevy Volt were both listed on the U.S. News & World Report\u2019s list of \u201c9 Cars with the Best Gas Mileage.\u201d\nThe 2018 Chevy Malibu Hybrid offers an average 49 mpg in the city. The Malibu Hybrid offers economically minded features such as a driver efficiency gauge to offer insight on how driving habits affect fuel economy.\nThe 2018 Chevy Volt has two electric motors and a gas-powered generator. On a completely charged battery, the Volt offers a range of around 53 miles from one charge. Once the charge is depleted, the car switches to gas energy and averages 42 mpg. Chevy states that with regular charging, Volt drivers will be able to travel upward of 1,000 miles before having to refill their gas tanks.\nElectric Chevy Cars\nChevy offers one fully electric car in its vehicle lineup: the Chevy Bolt.\nThe 2017 Chevy Bolt was recognized as the Green Car of the Year by the Green Car Journal. This is one of the biggest environmental honors in the automotive industry. It was chosen above electric cars from companies such as BMW, Chrysler, Toyota, and Kia. The fully electric Chevy Bolt beat out the competition with its wide range of features and record-breaking mileage range. The Bolt is the first electric vehicle offered by a major manufacturer to exceed a 200-mile driving range. That is quite a feat.\nThe limited driving range of electric vehicles has been a hurdle in making these environmentally friendly cars a workable option for the general public. With the Bolt, Chevy seems to have cleared that hurdle.\nThe 2018 Chevy Bolt has an estimated 238-mile driving range. That is beyond what most people need for their daily commute and then some. With a range like that, you wouldn\u2019t even need to charge the vehicle daily. So not only will you never need to get gas, but with the Chevy Bolt, you can charge your care less often than your cell phone.\nChevy is making progressive strides, not only making its company greener but its products greener as well. They have a wide range of cars available to fit any driver\u2019s needs and simultaneously lessen their environmental impact. Whether you want to fill up less often and save money on gas or stop going to the gas station completely, Chevy has a car that can make it happen.\nPosted in Chevy Cars\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

This truck has long been a favorite with hard workers, but Chevy doesn't rest when it comes to keeping the Silverado 1500 ahead of the competition. In fact, the model has seen several major updates in the past few years. The 2022 model year brought a complete redesign and a modern cabin filled with premium materials and high-tech features. This was followed up for the 2023 model year with an updated 3.0L Duramax turbo-diesel offering nearly 500 lb-ft of torque. Finally, the 2024 model year brings further refinements, including standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as a rebranding of the base 2.7L engine as the TurboMax.\nWith all of these updates, the 2024 Silverado 1500 remains ahead of the pack, handily outperforming rivals, from the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500 to the Toyota Tundra and Nissan Titan. Exclusive features like the powerful Duramax engine, Multi-Flex tailgate, and Super Cruise hands-free driving elevate the Chevy pickup, providing more capability for truck owners. Plus, Chevy satisfies adventurers with its collection of high-performance off-road options, including the rugged Trail Boss and ZR2 trims. It's time to take a look at what the 2024 Chevy Silverado 1500 brings to the table and the many ways it outperforms the competition in the full-size truck segment.\n383-495\nTorque (lb-ft)\n13,300\nTowing (lbs)\n89.1\nCargo Space (cu.ft.)\nStarting at\n$36,800[a]\n\n\nSilverado 1500 vs F-150\n    -----------------------\n\nChallenging Ford Head-On\nChevy vs Ford is a rivalry that stretches back well over a century. In fact, William C. Durant founded Chevy after a deal to buy out Ford fell through! Today, this rivalry is best seen in the ongoing competition between the Chevy Silverado 1500 and the Ford F-150. The F-150 just received a major overhaul for the 2024 model year, making it better than ever, but it still falls a bit short of the Silverado 1500 in some key aspects that matter to truck drivers. For instance, Ford finally dropped the old naturally-aspirated V6 from its engine lineup as part of the 2024 update, so both trucks now come standard with a turbocharged 2.7L engine. However, Ford's EcoBoost only offers 400 lb-ft of torque and is paired with an eight-speed transmission, while Chevy's TurboMax has 430 lb-ft of torque and a 10-speed transmission.\nChevy also stands out for offering the Silverado 1500 with not one but two V8 engine options, both of which use a traditional overhead valve design for greater reliability and torque. The larger 6.2L V8 available in the higher trims provides 420 hp and 460 lb-ft of torque, which is significantly more than Ford's lone V8 option. The Ford 5.0L V8 is a smaller overhead cam engine that only produces 400 hp and 410 lb-ft of torque. While Ford has invested heavily in fuel-saving technology like the turbocharged EcoBoost engines, Chevy has stuck with the trusted V8 options that truck owners have counted on for decades. There is even a powerful 3.0L Duramax turbo-diesel engine that was updated last year to generate 495 lb-ft of torque\u2013\u2013Ford only offered a diesel F-150 for a single model year, and it produced just 440 lb-ft of torque.\nOne of the biggest updates for the 2024 F-150 was Ford's addition of the all-new Ford Pro Access tailgate. This multifunction tailgate includes a small swing-out door insert in the main tailgate--it's a novel feature, to be sure, but it is a little underwhelming compared to the Multi-Flex tailgate that Chevy introduced for the Silverado 1500 all the way back in 2021. This feature is available on every trim of the 2024 Silverado 1500 and provides no fewer than six different configurations, including a bed step, an elevated work surface, and two different load stops. Plus, the Silverado 1500 comes standard with the Chevy Durabed, which has more cargo space than the F-150 and 12 tie-downs rated for 500 lbs per corner. If you're someone who uses their pickup truck for serious work, the 2024 Chevy Silverado 1500 has the 2024 Ford F-150 beat when it comes to convenience.\n\n\nSilverado 1500 vs Ram 1500\n    --------------------------\n\nBeating Ram at Its Own Game\nThe Ram 1500 is a truck that has made a name for itself in recent years by providing a higher level of luxury features, technology, and style. However, after its recent updates, the 2024 Chevy Silverado 1500 has the Ram 1500 beat when it comes to offering a more modern experience. From technology to comfort, Chevy has stepped up its game and left Ram in its dust, taking the crown as the premium option in the comparison. This is most evident the moment you step inside the cabin of a new Silverado. The higher trims of Chevy's truck are now loaded with top-notch materials, from open-pore wood trim to rich leather seats with custom stitching. Chevy has also done an excellent job offering a more traditional truck feel with a modern yet classic aesthetic, while Ram has leaned into sports car materials like carbon fiber and piano black trim.\nWhen it comes to technology, Chevy also stands out for the many features it includes. The 2024 Silverado 1500 comes standard with a massive 13.4-inch infotainment touchscreen and matching 12.3-inch digital driver information center if you opt for the LT trim or above. In contrast, the 2024 Ram 1500 only offers a pair of 12-inch displays, giving you less real estate to work with than the Silverado 1500. In fact, if you opt for the Tradesman or Big Horn trims, Ram only provides a tiny five-inch LCD radio screen. In addition, Chevy includes Google built-in, a revolutionary feature that allows you to access your favorite apps, from music to navigation, even if you don't have your phone with you. If you do have your phone, Chevy has added standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto to the 2024 Silverado 1500, so you don't have to bother with USB cables anymore.\nBut don't think that the Chevy Silverado 1500 is just a luxury truck\u2013\u2013this pickup was built for the job site and has no trouble outperforming the Ram 1500 when it comes to hard work. With a maximum towing capacity of 13,300 lbs when equipped with either its 6.2L V8 or 3.0L Duramax turbo-diesel, the Silverado 1500 easily outmuscles the Ram 1500, and its max towing capacity of 12,750 lbs. While Ram does have a HEMI V8, that engine is a rather small 5.7L that only produces 395 hp against the 420 hp offered by the Chevy 6.2L V8. Plus, the 2024 Ram 1500 is only available with mild-hybrid engines. To make up for the relatively low power of the 5.7 V8 and 3.6L V6, Ram has resorted to adding small electric motors to provide a low-end boost. However, even that added complexity isn't enough for the 2024 Ram 1500 to rival the 2024 Silverado 1500 when there is a job to be done.\n\n\nSilverado 1500 vs Sierra 1500\n    -----------------------------\n\nUndercutting GMC by Offering Premium Features for Less\nThe Chevy Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 are two sides of the same coin. Chevy and GMC are both branches of the GM family, with Chevy focusing on offering a wide range of vehicles for every buyer while GMC is dedicated to building premium trucks. Both the Silverado 1500 and Sierra 1500 are built on the same platform and share the same powertrains and features; the only difference is that the GMC version of the vehicle goes a little higher-end with its offerings and has a higher price tag to match.\nWhile the no-nonsense 2024 Silverado 1500 starts at $36,800, the most affordable version of the 2024 Sierra 1500 is $46,700.[a] That's a pretty sizable price difference given that the two vehicles offer virtually identical performance. In fact, the Silverado 1500 actually pulls ahead by a nose when it comes to hard stats, offering 13,300 lbs of towing capacity and 2,260 lbs of payload capacity compared to 13,200 lbs of towing and 2,240 lbs of payload in the Sierra 1500.\nIf you want a pure luxury truck, then there is no denying that the 2024 Sierra 1500 Denali Ultimate is the truck for you. It has a collection of ultra high-end features, from 16-way power-adjustable heated and ventilated massage seats to a 12-speaker Bose Premium Series surround sound system. Just be prepared to pay $82,500 for that level of luxury.\nHowever, the Chevy Silverado 1500 High Country is no slouch for luxury, offering the same features as the more attainable Sierra 1500 Denali (which is still a $69,900 truck) for a more palatable $62,700.[a] While they may not have a massage feature, you'll be able to relax in comfort in Chevy's perforated leather seats with heating and ventilation, and the Silverado 1500 offers a Bose sound system of its own, even if it doesn't have quite as many speakers. While GMC may be the premium brand in the GM family, Chevy does a fine job of making the same great capability and features available to a much wider range of drivers.\n\n\nSilverado 1500 vs Tundra\n    ------------------------\n\nTrouncing Toyota at Work and Play\nAfter languishing without a major redesign for 15 years, the Toyota Tundra was fully overhauled for the 2022 model year. However, the Japanese model is positioned as a lifestyle vehicle rather than a serious work truck, and it shows. The 2024 Tundra is a high-tech design with a hybrid powertrain and advanced technology, emphasizing fuel economy and comfort over the sort of reliable capability most truck owners need.\nFor instance, the sole powertrain option is a 3.4L twin-turbocharged V6, available with or without a hybrid assist. This provides 383 hp in its base configuration, putting it roughly on par with Chevy's proven 5.3L V8 engine. Opting for the Tundra hybrid provides 437 hp, slightly more than the Chevy 6.2L V8, but the added weight of the hybrid system reduces the max towing capacity from 12,000 lbs (already significantly less than the 13,300 lbs provided by the 2024 Silverado 1500) down to 11,450 lbs.\nToyota does get points for offering an eight-foot bed for the 2024 Tundra, although there is no single cab option and the maximum payload capacity is a relatively low 1,940 lbs. In contrast, the 2024 Silverado 1500 can haul up to 2,260 lbs and has more cargo space in its bed to boot. This difference in payload ratings is partially because Toyota has switched to a more comfort-oriented coil spring rear suspension instead of the traditional leaf spring suspension found in the Silverado 1500.\nToyota also doesn't offer any sort of multifunction tailgate, which can make it more difficult to live with if you are often loading and unloading the bed or commonly use your tailgate as a workbench. The Multi-Flex tailgate available on every trim of the 2024 Silverado 1500 goes a long way toward making every job just a little bit easier with its six available positions, including a hand bed step and two built-in loadstops.\nHowever, even as a lifestyle truck, the Tundra falls short. Its ultra-adventurous TRD Pro trim may be a bit more powerful than the Silverado 1500 ZR2, but it lacks the off-road performance features needed to dominate the competition. Incredibly, this supposed off-road option from Toyota provides just nine inches of ground clearance and a 26.2-degree approach angle.\nMeanwhile, the Silverado 1500 ZR2 has no less than 11.22 inches of ground clearance and a 33.5-degree approach angle, ensuring you can go anywhere, no matter what obstacles you encounter. Chevy also includes both front and rear electronic locking differentials, while the Tundra and every other truck in the segment only offers a rear electronic locking differential. Add the available Bison package with its steel bumpers, steel skid plates, and beadlock wheels to the 2024 Chevy Silverado 1500 ZR2, and you have an adventure machine that the 2024 Toyota Tundra can't hope to hold a candle to.\n\n\nSilverado 1500 vs Titan\n    -----------------------\n\nNissan Isn't Even in the Running\nThe 2024 model year marks the end of the road for the Nissan Titan, as the Japanese brand has confirmed that the model is slated to be discontinued. But after going 16 years without a major update and selling fewer than 20,000 units in 2023, it is no surprise that the Titan was headed for retirement. Compared to the updated 2024 Chevy Silverado 1500, the 2024 Nissan Titan is an aging model with limited features and even more limited performance.\nThe Titan's sole claim to fame is its standard 5.6L V8 engine, which is a unique feature in a segment where a V8 is usually an expensive upgrade. However, the Titan's high starting price of $46,040 means that you can actually upgrade to a V8 in the Silverado 1500 and still come out ahead. Even worse, Chevy's base 2.7L TurboMax engine actually has a higher max towing capacity, coming in at 9,500 lbs compared to the incredibly low 9,290 lbs of the Nissan V8.\nThings don't get any better when you look at payload ratings and cargo capacity. The 2024 Titan maxes out at a remarkably low 1,710 lbs of payload, which is just 26 lbs more than the midsize Chevy Colorado can handle. The 2024 Silverado 1500, with its maximum payload capacity of 2,260 lbs, is simply in another realm altogether. Further, Nissan only offers the Titan with short and standard bed options and has nothing to compete with Chevy's available long bed configuration that can fit items over eight feet long with the tailgate closed.\nPlus, Chevy has its Multi-Flex tailgate with built-in load stops and Durabed with 12 standard tie-downs to help secure any cargo. The Titan? We're honestly surprised it even offers a dampened tailgate for easy lowering. While the optional Titan boxes and Utili-track system are pretty cool, they cost extra and eat into the truck's already limited bed space.\nInside, as you might expect, the Titan is again severely outmatched. The seven-inch instrument cluster display and optional nine-inch center touchscreen offered by Nissan is antiquated compared to the 12.3-inch digital cluster and 13.4-inch infotainment screen found in the 2024 Silverado 1500. While Chevy has made wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto a standard feature on its full-size truck, the 2024 Titan only offers wireless Apple CarPlay on its top PRO-4X and Platinum trims and doesn't have wireless Android Auto available at all.\nNeedless to say, something like the Chevy Super Cruise, which offers hands-free driving on 750,000 miles of highways across North America, is not available on the Nissan Titan. If you are looking for a modern pickup truck that makes your life in the driver's seat less stressful and more productive, then you will want to skip over the 2024 Nissan Titan and go directly to the 2024 Chevy Silverado 1500.\n\n\nCheck Availability Form Opened\nCheck Availability\n\n\nFirst Name*\n\n\nLast Name*\n\n\nEmail*\n\n\nPhone\n\n\nZip Code*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferral ID \n\n\nYour Phone\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\n\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nSchedule Test Drive Form Opened\nSchedule Test Drive\n\n\nFirst Name*\n\n\nLast Name*\n\n\nEmail*\n\n\nPhone\n\n\nZip Code*\n\n\nWhat day would you like to schedule a test drive?\n\n\nWhat time would you like to schedule a test drive?\nPlease choose a time range above\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferral ID \n\n\n\nYour Comments\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\n\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nContact Us Form Opened\nContact Us\n\n\nFirst Name*\n\n\nLast Name*\n\n\nEmail*\n\n\nMessage*\n\n\n\nYour Comments\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nCourtesy Transportation Vehicle\nCall dealer for availability\nNew 2024Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Custom ---------------------------------------\nDetails\nMSRP $47,080\nCustomer Cash $3,000\nChevyman Discount* $8,000\nChevyman Deal $36,080\nTotal Value Savings $11,000\n\nOther Offers You May Qualify For:\nGM Healthcare Professional Offer $500\nGM Educator Offer $500\nGM First Responder Offer $500\nGM Military Offer $500\nGM College Offer $500\nDisclaimer:\nNew vehicle pricing includes all offers and incentives.

THE COMPETITION\n\nChevy Silverado 1500 vs. the Competition in Litchfield, IL\nLooking for a versatile, well-rounded full-size truck? The new Chevy Silverado 1500 is tough and capable, with a range of muscular engines that are up to any challenge you throw at them in Southwest IL. They also have class-leading cargo bed volume and a spacious cab. The new Ram 1500 and Ford F-150 present stiff competition for the Silverado 1500, but here at Steve Schmitt Chevrolet Buick GMC of Litchfield, we believe the Silverado 1500 beats its rivals in several key areas.\n\nShop Our Silverado 1500 Inventory\nShop Our Chevrolet Truck Inventory\nContact Us!\n\nUtility/Capability\nCargo Bed\nOne of the main reasons people in Southern IL drive trucks is for their handy cargo box. The new Chevy Silverado 1500 offers a 6.6-foot standard bed, an 8.1-foot long bed, or a 5.8-foot short bed. Carlinville drivers will appreciate that the Silverado 1500 offers best-in-class cargo bed volume.\nThe new Ford F-150 is available with 8-foot, 6.5-foot, and 5.5-foot beds, though not every bed is offered with every cab style.\nThe new Ram 1500 only offers cargo box sizes - a 6-foot-4-inch bed or a 5-foot-7-inch bed.\nTailgate\nThe new Chevy Silverado 1500 offers a multi-function tailgate called \"MultiFlex,\" which has a secondary cutout in the middle that can be folded down to allow more standing space behind the truck. The tailgate also folds down into a step for easier bed access or folds up to prevent longer loads from slipping out the back. People in Hillsboro will like that the Silverado 1500's MultiFlex tailgate has a weatherproof built-in Kicker audio system, a USB port, and an auxiliary input for tailgate parties or impromptu outdoor entertainment.\nThe new Ford F-150 does not offer a multi-purpose tailgate, although there is an optional power up-and-down feature and a tailgate step.\nThe new Ram 1500 does offer a 60/40-split multifunction tailgate that can swing down like normal or open outward to the sides like barn doors. However, it's tailgate doesn't come with a built-in audio system, a USB port, or an auxiliary input.\n\n\nTechnology\nDriver Assistance Features\nThe new Chevy Silverado 1500 is loaded with standard advanced active safety features for safer driving in Metro East. Staunton drivers will appreciate that each Silverado 1500 trim comes with the Chevy Safety Assist suite of driver aids, which includes a rearview camera, automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist with lane departure warning, a following distance indicator and automatic high beams.\nThe new Ford F-150 only comes standard with a rearview camera, lane departure warning, and forward collision mitigation. You must pay more to have other driver-assist aids in the F-150.\nThe only standard safety feature in the new Ram 1500 is a rearview camera, although there are many optional driver assistance features.\nInfotainment\nThe new Chevy Silverado 1500 now offers a 13.4-inch horizontally oriented infotainment touchscreen on LT trims and above. People in Litchfield will like that the Silverado 1500's infotainment system has Google voice command technology for sending texts, changing audio sources, and more.\nThe new Ford F-150's largest available touch screen is just 12.0 inches. It does not offer Google voice command capability.\nThe new Ram 1500 also has a maximum 12-inch infotainment touch screen and has no voice command feature.\nContact Steve Schmitt Chevrolet Buick GMC of Litchfield to Learn More about the New Silverado 1500\nThe new Chevy Silverado 1500 is more capable and tech-filled than ever. People in Southwest IL will appreciate that it now offers Super Cruise driver assistance technology for hands-free driving on certain highways.

THE COMPETITION - 2025 MODEL COMPARISON\n\nThe Chevrolet Silverado is a mainstay of the pickup truck world. But given the popularity of full-size pickup trucks here in America, the Silverado faces some serious competition. How does the Silverado stack up against the competing pick-ups from Ford and Ram? Schumacher Chevrolet of Little Falls has put together the following guide to help you navigate that question. Quite a few different configurations exist for all of these trucks, and the different uses for them are even more varied. So we'll try to give you as much of an overall idea of each truck as possible.\n\nView New Silverado Inventory\nView Used Silverado Inventory\nView Specials\n\nChevrolet Silverado 1500 VS Ram 1500\n\n\nThe first thing to be said about the Ram 1500 is that it doesn't offer the kind of configuration options that you get with the Silverado. For all the trim levels Ram offers, most are only offered with a choice of two engines, a third is available, but is only available for the very top trims. There is also no diesel option, a major strength of the Silverado 1500, which offers the only diesel engine in this segment. And the standard base engine in the Silverado is noticeably more powerful than the one found in the Ram. So it should come as no surprise that the towing capacity of the Silverado is higher than the Ram's by nearly two thousand pounds. There are fewer cab choices for the Ram too, with no regular cab being offered, part of the reason why the Ram also has a higher starting price. That also means that there is no long bed available, only a standard bed and a short bed to choose from. The Silverado has both of these options, making it easier to configure your truck for the task at hand.\n\nChevrolet Silverado VS Ford F-150\n\n\nAt first glance, it might be a bit harder to tell the difference between the Silverado and the F-150, as they offer the same cab/bed configuration options, and the F-150's engine lineup is as extensive as the Silverado's. But a closer look at the details starts to reveal some differences. For instance, we once again see a competitor that doesn't offer a diesel engine, making the Ford a less-appealing choice for those that do a lot of towing. Speaking of towing, while these two trucks offer nearly identical maximum towing capacities, it should be noted that the Silverado offers a much higher minimum towing capacity, with the lowest capacity of any Silverado configuration beating several configurations of the F-150 by more than a thousand pounds. A good thing to remember for those who aren't looking to specifically buy a towing vehicle, but will need to tow from time to time. But you don't have to take our word for it, the experts at Car & Driver have bestowed their prestigious 10Best award on the Silverado five times to the F-150's two. It shows a more consistent standard of quality for the Silverado\n\nWinner - Chevrolet Silverado\n\nWith any of these pickups, there are a lot more configuration options available than just what we've covered here. But as you can see, the Silverado starts off giving you more power, more utility, and more equipment for your money, and it only builds from there. But the Silverado should really be experienced in person, stop by Schumacher Chevrolet of Little Falls for a test drive today!\n\nView New Silverado Inventory\nView Used Silverado Inventory\nView Specials\n\nWebsite by Dealer.com AdChoices\n\nContact\nAbout\nPrivacy\nSitemap\n\n\n\n; ;"

The market is full of pickup trucks that offer quality performance and ruggedness. But is there one that stands out above the rest? At Steve Schmitt Inc. in Highland, IL, we think that you will want to get the Chevy Silverado 1500. But don't just take our word for it. Here is how the Silverado 1500 stacks up to its competitors.\n\nShop Our Silverado 1500 Inventory\nShop Our Chevy Truck Inventory\nContact Us!\n\nMore Engine Options than the Toyota Tundra\nWhen picking out your ideal pickup truck to drive in St. Louis, it can be nice to have plenty of engine options to pick from. If you need a work vehicle, you might want a diesel engine with lots of torque. If you are picking out a truck for everyday driving, you might want more horsepower. When you shop for a Silverado 1500, you can take your pick from four exciting engine options:\n\n2.7-liter Turbo High-Output engine (310 horsepower, 430 pound-feet of torque)\n5.3-liter V-8 engine (355 horsepower, 383 pound-feet of torque)\n6.2-liter EcoTec3 V-8 engine (420 horsepower, 460 pound-feet of torque)\nDuramax\u00ae 3.0-liter Turbo-Diesel engine (277 horsepower, 460 pound-feet of torque)\n\nMeanwhile, the Toyota Tundra only offers three engine options. None of the Toyota Tundra's engine options are V-8 or diesel engines. If you want a range of engine options to pick from, the Silverado 1500 gives you more choices and greater variety.\n\n\nCrucial Standard Safety Features (That Aren't Standard on the Ford F-150)\nYour safety and the safety of your passengers is essential when you are driving all over Edwardsville. That is why the Silverado 1500 comes standard with a Chevy Safety Assist, a suite of essential safety features to give you peace of mind every time you go out on the road. Standard safety features of the Silverado 1500 include:\n\nLane Keeping Assist with Lane Departure Warning: Monitors your position on the road and alerts you if you begin to drift out of your lane without using your turn signal\nBlind Spot Monitoring with Rear Cross-Traffic Alert: Monitors your blind spot and the area behind your vehicle, alerting you if you change lanes with a vehicle in your blind spot or if you back up with a vehicle approaching.\n\nThese safety features, standard on the Silverado 1500, are only available on the Ford F-150. That means you have to pay extra to get these features on a Ford F-150.\nBetter Cargo Capacity than the Ram 1500\nWhen you need to pack a lot of cargo onto your truck, it is important to make sure you don't overload it. Luckily, the Silverado 1500 gives Troy, IL, drivers plenty of space for all their cargo, thanks to a standard maximum payload capacity of 2,412 pounds and a standard cargo volume of 71.7 cubic feet. The Ram 1500 offers a payload capacity of 2,325 pounds and a cargo volume of 61.5 cubic feet. When you need to pack as much cargo as your truck will allow, the Silverado 1500 lets you pack more weight and gives you more space.\n\n\nBetter Towing Capacity than Any of the Competition\nWhen it comes to towing, none of these aforementioned vehicles can compare to the Silverado 1500.\nStandard Maximum Towing Capacities\n\nSilverado 1500: 9,100 pounds\nRam 1500: 7,690 pounds\nFord F-150: 5,000 pounds\nToyota Tundra: 8,300 pounds\n\nWhen it comes to standard towing capacity, the Silverado 1500 wins out.\nTest Drive a New Chevy Silverado Today\nWhether you need a powerful truck for tough jobs in Collinsville or a versatile vehicle for everyday driving in Greenville, IL, the Silverado 1500 is the choice for you.

It's important to note that some dealerships, like Red River Chevrolet, offer extended warranty options such as a Lifetime Powertrain Warranty for as long as the original owner keeps the vehicle. To maintain warranty coverage, owners must follow Chevrolet's recommended maintenance schedule and have their vehicle serviced at certified dealerships using genuine Chevrolet parts."

    "query": "\"Chevrolet Silverado 1500\" sustainability",
    "answer": "The Chevrolet Silverado 1500 has limited sustainability features compared to other vehicles in Chevrolet's lineup. While the brand is making strides in sustainability with electric vehicles like the Blazer EV, the Silverado 1500 remains primarily a traditional internal combustion engine truck. Chevrolet has discontinued hybrid versions of its full-size pickups, which previously offered higher fuel efficiency. The current Silverado 1500 does not appear to have significant sustainability-focused features, with some configurations even showing lower fuel economy than expected. Chevrolet's broader sustainability efforts are more evident in their electric vehicle offerings, which aim to reduce carbon footprints and environmental impact. However, for those seeking a more environmentally friendly option in the full-size truck segment, the Silverado 1500 may not be the most sustainable choice available."

The Silverado features standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as a rebranded TurboMax base 2.7L engine. It also boasts the innovative MultiFlex tailgate, which provides increased functionality and standing space behind the truck.
