Did you?\nYes No\n3.0 Duramax is awesome\nFebruary 26, 2022\nBy Happy owner from Lubbock Texas\nOwns this car\nI\u2019ve had many silverados in my years, all 1/2 tons since \u201877. Enjoyed most of them. Can\u2019t say much about the 700R4 transmission in the 90\u2019s however. But this 2020 Silverado RST little max is the trophy of them all. It\u2019s a fuel sipper with plenty of torque, which is awesome for towing. It averages 12 mpg towing and 30-34 mpg non towing. The 10 speed transmission performance is so smooth shifting, the performance of the little 3.0 is engineering at its best. I traded a 2016 Silverado Z71 5.3 for this truck. Wow, it puts that old \u201816 to shame. The truck is simply the best of the best in the 1/2 ton class. I have driven it 20k now and the only issue I\u2019ve had was the my link freezing up several times in a couple weeks time frame. Took it to the dealer in Biloxie as I was on a road trip and they reflashed the system. Whatever that did, that was a couple months back and issue has not reappeared. It has all the bells and whistles with the first Bose system I\u2019ve ever had in my 70 years. This is a phenomenal truck and I expect it will be my last. I can\u2019t imagine parting with it. I never hesitated buying this truck after my initial test drive in Lubbock, Texas. I was not able to make a deal in my hometown here and was able to make a deal over the phone with a Chevrolet dealership in Farmersbranch, Texas. It\u2019s sad another Chevrolet dealership 400 miles from my home can make a much greater deal than my local dealership. That\u2019s free enterprise however and for what this truck cost, you have to shop your best deal. I feel like I got a great deal and absolutely no regrets. The all around ownership experience of this Silverado has exceeded my expectations. The best in its class\nRating breakdown (out of 5):\n\nComfort 5.0\nInterior 5.0\nPerformance 5.0\nValue 5.0\nExterior 5.0\n\nReliability 5.0\n\n\nPurchased a New car\n\nUsed for Having fun\nDoes recommend this car\n\n13 people out of 13 found this review helpful.

I have 13K on it with no issues. Fuel economy is incredible for a full size off road truck. Overall average is 22 MPG and can get 30 MPG on flat terrain hiway with no wind at 70 MPH. My 2023 ZR2 with 6.2L averaged 15 MPG and required 93 octane which is $0.30-0.40/gal higher than diesel. I had no issues at 40K with 2023, just didn\u2019t like fuel economy/range of 6.2L. 3.0L DuraMax in my 2024 uses 1 gal DEF every 800-900 miles. Goes through sand, mud, and snow off road. 33\u201d tires and 2\u201d factory lift, manual front and rear lockers, and Multimactic DVSS shocks make it an off road beast.

The 5.3L v8 dynamic fuel management engine and 10 speed transmission provide a smooth yet powerful feel, which allows the \"skip fire\" engine to operate with as little as 2 cylinders under light load conditions. This system keeps all cylinders lubed and warm to prevent previous technology pitfalls while delivering excellent fuel economy (up to 25mpg). This keeps the \"gismo\" engine / system tricks of the other brands out of this truck. Additionally, I believe this LTZ is the best-looking full-size truck in the GM (and many competitive brand) lineups. The looks, features, interior room and fuel economy are all best of class. If you are looking for one, don't mess around find one with premium features.

Added a KN cold air intake which I do recommend. Bose factory sound system is awesome and the most quiet cab at highway speeds I have ever had in a truck and I have had several.

Its location on this page may change next time you visit.\n\nReviewed Feb. 10, 2025\n\nPurchased a 2021 Silverado Trail Boss (5.3L engine with Dynamic Fuel Management system) in March 2021. Truck ran fine until 20,000 miles when it suffered lifter collapse and bent rods on the passenger side of the engine. Shame on me for not researching before I purchased but it appears that Chevy has been knowingly installing defective lifters in their 5.3L engines for quite a few years. My build date was right in the sweet spot for defective lifters. Unfortunately, Chevy will only warranty a repair on the side of the engine that failed even though they know that the other side will fail at some point. So, my dealer did the warranty repair and handed me back the keys to my ticking time bomb. How can put my family in the truck and decide to leave town when I am rolling the dice on whether I will make it to my destination?\n\nI had no choice but to trade it for a Ford F150. Fortunately, I did not suffer any transmission issues when I owned it but I have had several failures of the 10-speed transmissions on several of the vehicles in my work fleet. I read recently about a class action suit about the transmission issues. While I owned my Silverado before my issues began, I decided to get a Blazer for my work vehicle. It has 12,000 miles and has already suffered a transmission failure. Chevrolet/GM needs to get a handle on their reliability/quality. I'm officially done with them and will never own another of their offerings.\n\nReviewed Feb. 5, 2025\n\n23 Silverado Trailboss. I'm on my 3rd radiator, 3rd battery and 3rd intercooler. Now waiting 3 months for a coolant valve. Truck sits broke for 3 months. GM can't even get a part expedited to dealership and refuses to reimburse my car rental. Their customer service is non existent. I would never buy or recommend gm to anybody. I wouldn't even take a free truck from them. I'm disappointed. How can they keep selling these things knowing the parts are bad for 4 years now they've known and keep producing and selling.\n\nNot sure how to choose?\n\nGet buying tips about Car Models delivered to your inbox.\n\nThanks for subscribing.\n\nYou have successfully subscribed to our newsletter!

The vehicle currently has 38,590 miles, it has been kept up to vehicle preventative maintenance specs. Yesterday the power steering went out. I have an extended warranty through MBPI which should cover the replacement of the part but thank god I was driving the vehicle yesterday because my wife would not have been able to make any sharp turns or turns at all. I have never had this happen on a vehicle before.\n\nThe vehicle is now at the dealership but there is a two week backlog for appointments. I am a retired combat veteran (21years) and have 100% VA disability. I contacted GM customer service about getting a rental or loaner and they said since it is over 36k miles I am out of luck. I can get a rental, once the truck is looked at and it is determined that over 4 hours is needed to repair the vehicle through my extended warranty. So I am out a vehicle until then. GM are within their legal right but their morals and customer service is lacking. I will never buy another GM product again. Hell my F150 treated me better.\n\nReviewed Dec. 26, 2024\n\nI purchased a new 2024 Silverado RST Electric Pickup truck for its safety features and super cruise. The system has failed over 14 times while driving and has been in the dealer shop over five times by my records. They haven\u2019t documented the additional visits because I raised the issue of the vehicle being a lemon, and multiple service repairs would justify the lemon status of the Silverado E RST Pickup truck. Each time they tell me different problems, they updated the firmware, rebooted the systems twice, and they tell me that the communication board has failed which affects the self-driving (super cruise) and all the other safety functions i.e. breaking, collision, etc. After having the car for a week, the Silverado RST almost drove me into a bridge wall at 60 miles per hour.\n\nI wanted to return the vehicle as being dangerous, unsafe and not usable for its intended purpose. They suggested I trade in my current $100,000 new Silverado RST vehicle (1 week old) for a value of $78,000, as the Silverado RST is a used vehicle now for a new 2025 Silverado RST and pay an additional $17,000. I am told since its new model year they have only one tech to fix the new electronics at the Chevrolet Millennium dealer. I\u2019ve been told Chevrolet is sending down their engineer to check the vehicle but hasn\u2019t shown up for over a month. I have been given many excuses with no resolutions however they have always been polite. This morning on 12-26-24, driving on the Southern State Parkway, the super cruise lost control and couldn\u2019t find the road per the display and drove straight through the curve toward the other lanes, fortunately I didn\u2019t crash.\n\nMy new 2025 Mercedes CLE 450 has all the same safety features as self-driving assist, and it works beautifully and has never failed. To add insult to injury the Chevy personnel praise Mercedes for their quality this morning as I dropped off the Silverado RST. For a $97,000 vehicle to have all these problems unresolved with intermittent safety failures I would never recommend this vehicle, I believe this vehicle is a lemon and unsafe. I am filing a Lemon Law claim because I don't believe the safety features are reliable, which is the principal reason why I purchased the Silverado E RST vehicle. I wouldn't recommend to any of my family members to purchase the Silverado E RST or any Chevrolet vehicle based upon my experience with Chevrolet over the last seven weeks. This is the first time in twenty years I bought an American vehicle to my dismay.\n\nReviewed Dec. 2, 2024\n\nPurchased new 2023 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Trail Boss with the 3.0 diesel. It has been sitting in the shop waiting for a part since August. I was just made aware that it will be another 2 months before they get the part. 6 months-1/2 a year of me paying on the truck to have it sitting at O\u2019Reilly Chevrolet. Do not purchase a truck from Chevrolet!\n\nReviewed Nov. 27, 2024\n\nI just recently purchased a 2024 Chevy Silverado 2500. I was extremely excited about my new truck and was quite happy with the dealership. Unfortunately when I went to pick the truck up, I was informed it had a dent in the rear driver side door. I was told they will take care of the dent no charge, but I would need to come back on a Saturday as that's the only day that department works. The issue lies in that I live 1.5 hours away from the dealership and was told they were the only ones that could perform the work.\n\nAbout a month after I had my truck, the cover on top on the passenger side mirror flies off, to which I had to go into the local dealership and have it repaired under warranty. Now just yesterday (3 months after I bought it) I noticed one of the lights on the roof isn't working. So once again I'm having to go to the local dealership to have another warranty fix completed. So, this is 3 warranty issues in less than 4 months of purchasing a $70,000 truck. I'm beginning to get very frustrated with my new Chevy and am thinking twice about every purchasing another one again.\n\nReviewed Nov. 5, 2024\n\nI am on my second 2500Hd Silverado. I am writing this review because on the very first service at 7600 miles I was told that my tires were excessively wearing. The first truck I had the tires were worn out at 23000 miles and the ones on my 2024 will be lucky to see 12000 miles. I called GM customer service and was told if the truck had less than 12000 miles on it that they should cover the tires under warranty so I took it to the dealer to have them look at it again. After a week they called me back and said that unless the tires were defective they could not replace them. The tires are Goodyear Wranglers so now I'm going to be out 2000 dollars for tires because GM must have used covid leftover tires. DO NOT BUY A 2500 WITH THE GOODYEAR TIRES. Looks like my next one will be a f250.\n\nReviewed Oct. 28, 2024\n\nDon't buy a Chevy. I have a truck that is 2 years old and 70 thousand miles old, and I have a catalyst problem already. Not only that, but they have issues with the radio\u2014many problems. You a favor and don't buy a Chevy. They are not the same substantial trucks anymore. They use so much electrical stuff. They make trucks with a bunch of problems.\n\nReviewed Oct. 27, 2024\n\nI was driving to work and my check engine light came on and said reduced engine power! Come to find out a lifter broke! Then the camshaft and rockers broke! Since 60600 miles they said warranty was out! 2900 bucks later back on the road! They informed me that they have been having problems with the lifter! But they couldn\u2019t help me out! The truck is two years old. First time I bought a Chevy! Should have stayed with Ford. I will never buy another General Motors vehicle again!\n\nReviewed Sept. 24, 2024\n\nI just sold my 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LTZ after 8 months, my honest opinion is I am very disappointed, why because of the ride quality, not a pure V8 engine, too much highway noise coming in cabin, and had it in the shop 4 times for software problems, I really hated the, DFM. My second disappointment was the dealership I went to, be very careful and choose your dealership wisely. I will never buy another silverado until they start building real quality trucks. The money I wasted on this truck taught me a valuable lesson, don't settle for less demand quality or don't buy it.\n\nChevrolet Silverado Company Information\n\nConsumerAffairs is not a government agency.

My last truck was a 2002 Chevy Silverado 1500 LS. I drove it 22 years and put over 200,000 miles on it. It was a great truck, so I wanted to replace it with another one. In late November, I purchased a 2024 Silverado 1500 LTZ with all the bells and whistles and I couldn\u2019t be happier with a vehicle. It looks fantastic, Summit White, crew cab with short bed and 20\u201d wheels have it sitting at the perfect height. Inside there is plenty of headroom for 6 ft plus people. The seats are super comfortable and it drives and rides fabulously. The interior is amazing. My wife, who generally doesn\u2019t care much for trucks raves about it every time she sits in it. She says she can\u2019t believe how comfortable it is and wants to take trips in it. If there is anything I have to say that is a bit negative is how the 10 speed transmission works at slow speeds. At times, I experience a sort of surging with it. The truck apparently \u201clearns\u201d your driving habits, so that may have something to do with it. Otherwise, I really enjoy everything about it.

Less than a month of owning it, one day it decided not to start and the battery was completely dead. I received an e-mail from OnStar saying there was an airbag issue and to contact the dealer within 1 day. This was a Sunday, so I did an online service appointment for Monday. Got the truck in and after going insane about not getting any calls from the dealership days after it had been there, I was told the front collision module was shorting out and a GM engineer was assigned to my truck to diagnose it. After nearly 2 weeks at the dealership, I got the truck back and wouldn't you know, the same issue again. It's back at the dealership and I am now told the GM engineer may have to come to the dealership to diagnose the truck. In addition to the safety issues regarding forward collision detection, the key fob will randomly lock itself inside the vehicle, and the factory paint job is a disaster on the drivers side doors. Never took notice to the paint since I picked it up while it was raining out. In direct sunlight the paint looks like a hologram and I was told by the Sales Manager and Service Dept that it is a factory defect.

Best ive gotten is 28.7 and average over 23 but im not shy with the pedal. There are only 2 things im not fond of, the seats aren't the most comfortable and the new infotainment system is very slow. I came from a ram with Uconnect 5 so I guess I expected more. The position of the screen is much better but the system itself has a 2 or 3 second lag doing almost everything and isn't nearly as configurable.

Enter Google. 50% of the time I try to call out. it keeps telling me to enter the string. The nav requires a subscription, on the old system you could turn on Android auto and display your nav if you didn't have it. Now, you can't turn on maps while android auto is on. Old system you could use in the mountains. The new system is unreliable Trash that looks pretty and costs 80K. It frustrates me to no end and makes me want to sell the truck.\nSafety\n4 out of 5 stars\nTechnology\n1 out of 5 stars\nPerformance\n4 out of 5 stars\nInterior\n5 out of 5 stars\nComfort\n4 out of 5 stars\nReliability\n4 out of 5 stars\nValue\n1 out of 5 stars\nReport Abuse\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n...\n6\n\nItems per page:\n51050\nWrite a vehicle review\nShop Silverado 1500 2022 for sale\nRelated Used 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 info\nPopular new car reviews and ratings\n\nKia Sorento Kia Sorento\nBMW BMW X5\nTesla Model 3S\n2024 Highlander\n2026 Toyota Highlander News\n2024 Telluride\nRangerover\n2026 Subaru Crosstrek News\nTesla Model S Plaid\nToyota Corolla Cross Le\n\nOther models to consider\n\n2024 Silverado 1500\nChevy City Express Vans\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD\nChevy Blazer Ev\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD\n2024 Blazer EV\nChevrolet Silverado 3500HD 2025\nChevrolet Silverado 2500HD 2025\n2024 Silverado 2500HD\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500\n\nResearch similar vehicles\n\n2024 GMC Sierra 1500\n2025 Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD\n\nOther models\n\nUsed Toyota Camry-Hybrid in Martinsburg, WV\nUsed Honda Accord-Plug-In-Hybrid in Nicholasville, KY\nUsed Lincoln Corsair in Ontario, CA\nUsed Lexus LX-450 in Bear, DE\nNew Mclaren GTS for Sale in Wyandotte, MI\nUsed Lexus Is-200T in Hays, KS\nUsed Mazda Mazdaspeed-Mx-5-Miata in Lockport, NY\nUsed Plymouth Prowler in Fort Payne, AL\nUsed Suzuki Equator in Old Bridge, NJ\nUsed Ford Explorer-Sport-Trac in Dublin, CA\n\nBack to Top\nBack to Top\nJoin Edmunds\nReceive pricing updates, shopping tips & more!\nEmail Address\nSign Up\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the Edmunds app\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\nCareers\nYour Ad Choices\nPrivacy Statement\nVisitor Agreement\nAccessibility\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\nEdmunds Information\n\n\u00a9 Edmunds.com, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of CarMax, Inc.
