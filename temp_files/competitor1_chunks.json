(A $60,000 rear-drive Cybertruck is available to order but won\u2019t enter production until at least 2025.) The AWD Cybertruck matches the F-150 Lightning in performance and doesn\u2019t cost much more given its extra standard features, and its 340-mile range estimate edges out the Ford\u2019s. The F-150 Lightning not only cuts your tailpipe emissions and fuel bills, but it\u2019s also a performance truck with sports-car acceleration and uncommonly sophisticated handling.",
